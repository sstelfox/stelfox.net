In Part 4 of the Level 1 series, the host Andrew Price is teaching about loop selects which very simply is holding down Alt while clicking on a vertex. The issue wasn&amp;rsquo;t working for me though I found quite a few other users experiencing the issue.
The most common fix was when people had three button mouse emulation enabled (a common setting people turn on when using laptops or Macs).</description></item><item><title>Fixing Dark Input Boxes in Firefox</title><link>https://stelfox.net/blog/2019/04/fixing-dark-input-boxes-in-firefox/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2019 11:53:22 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://stelfox.net/blog/2019/04/fixing-dark-input-boxes-in-firefox/</guid><description>I recently began trying out Cinnamon as my desktop environment and I&amp;rsquo;ve been thoroughly enjoying it. The only issue I was having was occasionally a page&amp;rsquo;s form input fields would have a dark background while still having dark text making it impossible to read, and very difficult to write.
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t happening everywhere, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t track down what about a website would cause the issue. Most prominently for me was when this showed up in AWS&amp;rsquo;s interface.</description></item><item><title>Reflashing Cisco Catalyst With XMODEM</title><link>https://stelfox.net/blog/2019/03/reflashing-cisco-catalyst-with-xmodem/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Mar 2019 23:26:30 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://stelfox.net/blog/2019/03/reflashing-cisco-catalyst-with-xmodem/</guid><description>One of the Cisco Catalyst 3750 I had to work on recently had it&amp;rsquo;s flash completely wiped. When this happens you can only flash the filesystem using the XMODEM serial console. This is a fairly well documented process on Windows. On Linux most of the documented ways involve switching between multiple utilities and can be tricky. I wanted to documented how I did this and possibly help other in the same situation.</description></item><item><title>Hosting Your Own Private Git Repo</title><link>https://stelfox.net/blog/2018/12/hosting-your-own-private-git-repo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Dec 2018 18:53:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stelfox.net/blog/2018/12/hosting-your-own-private-git-repo/</guid><description>Git was built and developed with the intention of being a distributed reversion control system. Most people now use it with one or another central repository even when working on large teams which is perfectly fine if that model works for you and your team.
It can be useful to quickly work with others on private repositories without requiring them to get on your platform of choice, or for sensitive repositories keep the repository entirely under your control.</description></item><item><title>SPF and Google Site Verification in Route 53</title><link>https://stelfox.net/blog/2018/06/spf-and-google-site-verification-in-route-53/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jun 2018 11:36:09 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://stelfox.net/blog/2018/06/spf-and-google-site-verification-in-route-53/</guid><description>Route53 doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow multiple definitions of the same name/type pair of DNS entries which is quite a headache. This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve had a conflict of a TXT record in Route53 at the base, specifically both Google&amp;rsquo;s site verification, and SPF records both want to live at the root of the domain. The site verification record needs to stay around as Google periodically re-verifies the domain.
To get this to work you need to quote both the Google verification string and the SPF record, but you also have to ensure that there is a newline in the field.</description></item><item><title>Timelapse of a Linux Desktop</title><link>https://stelfox.net/blog/2018/06/timelapse-of-a-linux-desktop/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jun 2018 16:37:39 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://stelfox.net/blog/2018/06/timelapse-of-a-linux-desktop/</guid><description>I have the privilege of working full remote. To stay connected with our other remote workers and the main office we keep a live video conference going all the time. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty convenient and definitely allows me to continue to feel connected with the company.
During one of our stand ups, a coworker mentioned that they&amp;rsquo;d like to see how things looked over time. I have three 1440p monitors and largely leave the video conference on my right most window, which makes recording (an audio free) timelapse pretty easy with FFmpeg.</description></item><item><title>Parsing HTTP Responses in Ruby</title><link>https://stelfox.net/blog/2018/05/parsing-http-responses-in-ruby/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 May 2018 07:53:19 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://stelfox.net/blog/2018/05/parsing-http-responses-in-ruby/</guid><description>Normally handling HTTP responses in Ruby is rather straight forward. There is a native library in Ruby that handles HTTP requests which parses the responses into a neat data structure that you can then operate on. What if you want to work on stored HTTP responses outside of a connection though? This was the situation I found myself in and thanks to a series of unusual decisions in the Ruby core library I found myself left out in the cold.</description></item><item><title>Converting OpenLDAP Schemas to LDIF</title><link>https://stelfox.net/blog/2018/03/converting-openldap-schemas-to-ldif/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Mar 2018 20:20:22 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://stelfox.net/blog/2018/03/converting-openldap-schemas-to-ldif/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing software to work against an OpenLDAP instance, with a highly customized schema. The operators of the existing system only had the schema files and searching around found several elaborate ways to convert the files which I tried with mixed success. After doing the research to figure this out, it became clear I could probably have used slapcat and have dumped the active schema directly to LDIF.
As a sample of how I converted these, I&amp;rsquo;ll use the rfc2307bis.</description></item><item><title>Including LDIF Files in OpenLDAP</title><link>https://stelfox.net/blog/2018/03/including-ldif-files-in-openldap/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Mar 2018 20:20:22 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://stelfox.net/blog/2018/03/including-ldif-files-in-openldap/</guid><description>While setting up and OpenLDAP server I found my distribution shipped with a couple of schema files, but no equivalent LDIF files. I found ways to convert the file using slapcat and slaptest and the files were valid on their own.
I was specifically trying to bootstrap an OpenLDAP server, with it&amp;rsquo;s schema, from scratch for a CI/CD system to test against. To accomplish this I was making use of the include directive in a configuration LDIF file and saw some very odd behavior.</description></item><item><title>Cross-Compiling Gentoo for Xilinx Boards</title><link>https://stelfox.net/blog/2017/12/cross-compiling-gentoo-for-xilinx-boards/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Dec 2017 17:49:22 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://stelfox.net/blog/2017/12/cross-compiling-gentoo-for-xilinx-boards/</guid><description>Note: If you&amp;rsquo;ve come here looking to build a root filesystem for 32 bit ARM devices I suspect everything but the build tuple will be the same. The issues that need to be worked around largely packaging and profile issues that should all be the same.
I got a hold of a Zynq 7100 development board, and while I&amp;rsquo;ve played with some embedded ARM microcontrollers such as the STM32F3 series and more basic RISC style microcontrollers like Atmel&amp;rsquo;s SAMD10 and Atmega lines, I&amp;rsquo;ve never played with FPGA development before so I considered this an interesting learning opportunity.</description></item></channel></rss>
