It was quickly rooted and I began playing with various ROMs that had been pre-built for the Nexus 5. My first stop was the CyanogenMod. Since I&amp;rsquo;d last used CyanogenMod they added a built-in framework that provides transparent text message encryption called WhisperPush.
WhisperPush is an implementation of Moxie Marlinspike&amp;rsquo;s highly respected TextSecure and I was very excited at the possibility of using it.</description></item></channel></rss>
