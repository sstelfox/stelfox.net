I don&amp;rsquo;t have any legal copies of Windows to put on my server and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go through all that effort`
It really needs to be done within a DOS environment. I downloaded the file PEC6100BIOS017000.exe from Dell&amp;rsquo;s support website (locally hosted copy) as well as the 2.</description></item></channel></rss>
