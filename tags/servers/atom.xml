      <description>I randomly started experiencing an issue with one blade in one of my PowerEdge C6100 blades. It wouldn&#39;t obey all commands issued too it via IPMI or through the BMC&#39;s web interface. Additionally the blade would randomly power on when off, and the front light would consistently blink as if a hardware fault was detected.
This has been bothering me for a while, but it was my spare blade and wasn&#39;t affecting my lab in anyway so I&#39;ve ignored it.</description>

      <description>I just received my Dell PowerEdge C6100 and found it&#39;s software quite a bit outdated. After searching around quite a bit I found the resources lacking for explaining how to perform these updates. So in this post I&#39;m going to quickly cover updating the BMC firmware on each blade.
The system I received had four different versions of the BMC software installed, additionally Two were branded as MegaRAC and the others branded as Dell.</description>

      <description>The BIOS was quite a bit more complicated and there was a few options that I had available to try, all of which require either Windows or DOS environments. I don&#39;t have any legal copies of Windows to put on my server and didn&#39;t want to go through all that effort`
It really needs to be done within a DOS environment. I downloaded the file PEC6100BIOS017000.exe from Dell&#39;s support website (locally hosted copy) as well as the 2.</description>
