      <description>Route53 doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow multiple definitions of the same name/type pair of DNS entries which is quite a headache. This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve had a conflict of a TXT record in Route53 at the base, specifically both Google&amp;rsquo;s site verification, and SPF records both want to live at the root of the domain. The site verification record needs to stay around as Google periodically re-verifies the domain.
To get this to work you need to quote both the Google verification string and the SPF record, but you also have to ensure that there is a newline in the field.</description>
