      <description>While cleaning up some tech debt, a curious issue cropped up. Nginx was running in an alpine container as a front end load balancer. It had a dynamic config that got periodically updated by a sidecar, and had filebeat shipping logs out to a central collector but otherwise was just a very simple Nginx config.
Every now and then the container would crash, it would automatically recover fast enough no alarms were lost and the clients would just resend their requests.</description>
