This was done as a compromise with administrators who didn&amp;rsquo;t want to change their egress filtering, but wanted to allow me to continue doing my normal work.
I already run several webservers, including this one, and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to give up exclusive access to the precious TCP port 443. The recommended way to deal with this is to make use of the port-share option built into OpenVPN.</description></item></channel></rss>
