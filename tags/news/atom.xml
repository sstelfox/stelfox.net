      <description>During my daily review of various new sources I came across one particular article that was both concerning and very amusing.

They&#39;ve been getting used by the military, law enforcement, recently Amazon (though they&#39;ve abandoned that for now), you can even purchase one for your iPhone at airports.
The security of these systems hasn&#39;t been thoroughly tested publicly, though there is at least one report of a military drone being stolen already.</description>
