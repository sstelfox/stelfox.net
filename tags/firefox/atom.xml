      <description>I recently began trying out Cinnamon as my desktop environment and I&#39;ve been thoroughly enjoying it. The only issue I was having was occasionally a page&#39;s form input fields would have a dark background while still having dark text making it impossible to read, and very difficult to write.
It wasn&#39;t happening everywhere, and I couldn&#39;t track down what about a website would cause the issue. Most prominently for me was when this showed up in AWS&#39;s interface.</description>
