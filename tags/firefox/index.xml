The only issue I was having was occasionally a page&amp;rsquo;s form input fields would have a dark background while still having dark text making it impossible to read, and very difficult to write.
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t happening everywhere, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t track down what about a website would cause the issue. Most prominently for me was when this showed up in AWS&amp;rsquo;s interface.</description></item></channel></rss>
