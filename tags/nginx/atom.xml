      <description>DNS-over-TLS is a relatively new privacy enhancing protocol that encrypts all of your DNS requests to a trusted server. In an age when airports, and coffee shops are outsourcing &amp;lsquo;free wifi&amp;rsquo; to corporate entities that are likely harvesting as much data as they can this is a nice addition. I largely use VPNs when connected to these access points which provides at least as good protection as DNS-over-TLS which has caused me to largely overlook this development.</description>

      <description>While working on a replacement webserver, I encountered some odd behavior which took a bit to track down to CloudFlare. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a bug or an issue with CloudFlare, it was just unexpected.
The server was configured to respond to www.example.tld as well as example.tld, to both encrypted and unencrypted connections. Any requests to the www. domain get redirected to https://example.tld. The config was roughly:
server { listen 80; listen [::]:80; listen 443 ssl http2; listen [::]:443 ssl http2; server_name www.</description>
