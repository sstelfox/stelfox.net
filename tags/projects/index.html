      <aside>Posted at: 2009-11-04 16:36:45 -0500</aside>
      <article>
        <p>So for giggles I wrote a simple web crawler that archived any image it found on
a site that rapidly updated. My plan was to take all of the images resize them
to a fraction of what they were and make a collage progression of the images
posted over a 24 hours period. If that was successful I was going to try and
sort the image by the highest peak on a gray scale histogram of the image.</p>

<p>I let my crawler go and stopped it after a 24 hour period. I ls&#39;d the directory
the images were being saved in to see how many I got and my ssh session locked
up... Or so I thought. I hit Ctrl - C and nothing happened... So I closed my
window and opened a new one. Did the same ls and the same thing happened. At
this point I was really confused, did my system get compromised?  Maybe a
trojan ls was put on my system that was broken somehow?</p>

<p>The last thought put me into a panic, I raced to a system that held incremental
backups of this entire system and ran an md5sum on /bin/ls on it and on every
ls that I could find in the backup. There hadn&#39;t been any change. At this point
I was fairly certain that wasn&#39;t the case so I moved on...</p>

<p>Maybe there was a filename that hit some weird glitch in ls&#39;s programming
causing it too lock up. If this was the case how should I go about fixing it? I
started thinking about how it would be a nice contribution to the community if
I could figure out the error and report it, but I decided to take the lazy way
out.</p>

<p>I cd&#39;d to the directory and ran an rm -f * and was greeted with this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/bin/rm: Argument list too long.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wait what? All I get was this irritating and slightly elusive error message. So
the * was being expanded, and making the list too long? To be sure I started
hunting in the man pages. <code>man rm</code> recommended me to <code>info coreutils &#39;rm
invocation&#39;</code>. I read through and couldn&#39;t find any limitations or warnings that
might relate to the problem. The only thing I could find in there was a line
that said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>GNU <code>rm&#39;, like every program that uses the</code>getopt&#39; function to parse its
arguments...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alrighty moving on... so getopt is parsing it&#39;s options... man and info pages
on getopt don&#39;t really reveal anything... So to Google!</p>

<p>After a bit of googling I found the answer, getopt&#39;s argument limit is 1024.
So... how many files did I have? I wanted to give ls one more try... I typed it
in and sure enough console froze... or did it? I walked away and did other
things. When I came back I had a large list of files, longer than my console
buffer... Ok-day, lets try this again &#39;ls -l | wc -l&#39;. After about five minutes
it came back again with just the number.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>177654</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whoa... I wasn&#39;t expecting that... So how do I get around it... &#39;find . | xargs
rm -f&#39; and.... WOO Victory! The directory is clean and happy again... Now i&#39;ll
just have to figure out how to cut down the number of files, or at the very
least organize them into more managable chunks...</p>
