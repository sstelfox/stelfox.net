      <description>Route53 doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow multiple definitions of the same name/type pair of DNS entries which is quite a headache. This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve had a conflict of a TXT record in Route53 at the base, specifically both Google&amp;rsquo;s site verification, and SPF records both want to live at the root of the domain. The site verification record needs to stay around as Google periodically re-verifies the domain.
To get this to work you need to quote both the Google verification string and the SPF record, but you also have to ensure that there is a newline in the field.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to do a more detailed post on emailing from Amazon&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure soon, but in the meantime I wanted to quickly throw out solutions too a couple of problems I encountered. These are all specific too Amazon&amp;rsquo;s Route 53, and most are user error (myself).
SPF Invalid Characters or Format After generating my SPF record, I jumped into Route 53, created a new record pasted in my record, attempted to save and received the following message:</description>

      <description>The current large project I&amp;rsquo;m working on is going to be hosted on AWS and I was requested to do a cost estimate. Looking into it, it quickly became clear that reserved instances could potentially save quite a bit of cash but there was a catch (isn&amp;rsquo;t there always?).
There is an upfront cost for reserving the instance and in exchange you get a reduced hourly rate. After running the numbers one thing wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear too me, is the upfront cost credit towards running machines or a fee you never see again?</description>
