I already owned a Ubiquiti EdgeRouter PoE 5 which has been battle tested at easily routing a gigabit worth of small packets.
When setting up my service, the representative I talked to told me I was able to use my own router, but I would still need to get a Google Fiber Network Box.</description></item><item><title>Quick and Silent Gigabit Packet Interception</title><link>https://stelfox.net/blog/2018/05/quick-and-silent-gigabit-packet-interception/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 May 2018 00:55:09 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://stelfox.net/blog/2018/05/quick-and-silent-gigabit-packet-interception/</guid><description>I regularly find myself inspecting traffic on Linux systems. Usually I&amp;rsquo;m already on the client or server when doing this (such as when diagnosing weird low level app behavior, or unknown, or unusual traffic). It has been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve needed to silently be the wire between two black boxes.
While verifying link level information about bypassing my Google Fiber Network Box I needed to be that wire again. Before I connected any wires to anything I needed to be sure I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t accidentally leak traffic as I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what would impact the link.</description></item></channel></rss>
