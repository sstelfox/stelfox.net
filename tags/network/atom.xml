      <description>I regularly find myself inspecting traffic on Linux systems. Usually I&#39;m already on the client or server when doing this (such as when diagnosing weird low level app behavior, or unknown, or unusual traffic). It has been a while since I&#39;ve needed to silently be the wire between two black boxes.
While verifying link level information about bypassing my Google Fiber Network Box I needed to be that wire again. Before I connected any wires to anything I needed to be sure I wouldn&#39;t accidentally leak traffic as I wasn&#39;t sure what would impact the link.</description>
