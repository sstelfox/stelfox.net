      <title>Unable to Enter LUKS Passphrase</title>

      <description>While setting up a gentoo install with a full disk encryption, I continuously got to a point where the passphrase would show up on boot but I was unable to enter the passphrase. The behavior of the keyboard was also odd, it would toggle it&amp;rsquo;s numlock light every couple of button presses.
Once again this was an issue that was hard to search for, and most other people asking it seemed to only get snarky non-answers which seem so prevalent in forums.</description>

      <title>Downgrading Glibc in Gentoo</title>

      <description>While refining some automated setup scripts at some point I upgraded to a testing/unstable version of glibc. When I attempted to get the box back on to the stable version I hit a solid protection mechanism built into the portage scripts that prevents downgrading glibc. Attempts will give you the following error message:
 * Sanity check to keep you from breaking your system: * Downgrading glibc is not supported and a sure way to destruction * ERROR: sys-libs/glibc-2.</description>

      <title>File in Wrong Format</title>

      <description>I have been recently attempting to cross compile a custom Gentoo profile targetting a Xilinx board as I found their distribution to be unmanageable (PetaLinux as hacked together sub-distro of Yocto). I had several issues with the default profile (embedded) conflicting with other critical packages. I&amp;rsquo;ll do a detailed post later on for building that entire root filesystem.
I came across one issue which didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have a well-documented solution.</description>

      <title>Gentoo Fstab Failure</title>

      <description>I use Gentoo with OpenRC quite a bit both for my personal servers and as a compilation test bed for new software since I can control the dependency versions very tightly. I have a set of scripts I&amp;rsquo;ve been using for quite some time that handle setting up a hardened, fairly minimal install.
I recently encountered a weird issue with them that resulted in an esoteric error that prevented my host from fully booting and leaving the root filesystem read-only.</description>

      <title>Cron Daemon</title>

      <description>Cron is a pretty standard utility and there isn&amp;rsquo;t much to it. I generally use cronie as my cron daemon with the associated anacron. Cron runs tasks periodically, and anacron helps ensure that a missed task will get run if it was off or powercycled when it would have otherwise run.
File Format The config format differs slightly between crontabs, regular cron files, and anacron entries. At the beginning of all the files environment variables can be set using key=value pairs to control the behavior of cron and anacron followed by entries for that file one to a line.</description>

      <title>Syslog-NG</title>

      <description>Syslog-NG is a fast, reliable, and secure syslog daemon that can do advanced processing and log centralization while maintaining a sane configuration file syntax. I&amp;rsquo;ve recently come to vastly prefer it over my previous long term favorite Rsyslog.
It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that when modifying the logs statements, they will be processed in order. This means log statements that finalize a message will never make it past that statement. This finalization behavior can be a great tool for optimizing the processing path of logs but can result in unexpected behavior if you don&amp;rsquo;t pay attention when re-ordering the statements.</description>

      <title>CFSSL</title>

      <description>CFSSL is a toolkit of utilities for TLS PKI infrastructures and supports more functionality than I&amp;rsquo;ve personally needed. It is a fast and convenient way to setup and manage a multi-layer internal certificate authority.
I&amp;rsquo;ve used it to generate an internal root CA, with sub-CAs for internal only server certificates, and separate CAs for each domain of client certificates (such as VPN, log, mail, and LDAP servers). This allows the root CA to be protected more stringently than specific domains.</description>

      <title>Investigating LVM From Dracut</title>

      <description>In my my last post, I covered finding logical volumes that were missing from LVM from within a live CD (which is effectively a whole standard environment). Working with dracut is quite a bit more limited.
Turns out that the commands I&amp;rsquo;m normally used to for operating and inspecting LVM volumes can all be accessed as a second parameter to the lvm tool like so:
$ lvm vgscan $ lvm pvscan $ lvm lvscan For my particular issue, it led me to notice that block device of my root filesystem was missing due to a missing kernel driver&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Visible Yet Missing Logical Volumes</title>

      <description>While working on an automated install script for an embedded board, I hit an issue with the logical volumes never showing up in /dev/mapper, and in turn unable to be mounted. This left me in the dracut emergency shell (after about three minutes), with little to go on beyond the following error:
[187.508531] dracut Warning: Could not boot. [187.510560] dracut Warning: /dev/disk/by-uuid/5681-902D does not exist [187.512534] dracut Warning: /dev/mapper/system-root does not exit [187.</description>

      <title>Server Naming Convention</title>

      <description>Over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself using many different naming schemes for servers under my control. I came across a naming convention that finally feels correct. That blog post is quite well written and will let it stand on its own. In the event it ever disappears the important bits (and those where I&amp;rsquo;ve personalized it) are included here.
There are ultimately two or three DNS names that each host receives.</description>
