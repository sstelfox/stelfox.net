    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While running an aide check on one of my servers after updating it, I started
seeing a large number of very concerning warning messages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt;
  &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;/usr/sbin/prelink: /bin/mailx: at least one of file's dependencies has changed since prelinking
Error on exit of prelink child process
/usr/sbin/prelink: /bin/rpm: at least one of file's dependencies has changed since prelinking
Error on exit of prelink child process
/usr/sbin/prelink: /sbin/readahead: at least one of file's dependencies has changed since prelinking
Error on exit of prelink child process
/usr/sbin/prelink: /lib64/libkrb5.so.3.3: at least one of file's dependencies has changed since prelinking
Error on exit of prelink child process
/usr/sbin/prelink: /lib64/libgssapi_krb5.so.2.2: at least one of file's dependencies has changed since prelinking
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list went on with maybe a total of forty packages and libraries. My initial
reaction was &amp;#39;Did I get hacked?&amp;#39;. Before running the updates I ran an aide
verification check which returned no issues and the files that were now
displaying the issue were in the packages that got updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was the next worse scenario? The packages had been tampered with and I
just installed malicious files. This didn&amp;#39;t seem likely as the packages are all
signed with GPG and an aide check would have caught tampering with my trust
database, the gpg binary, or the aide binary. Still a key could have been
comprimised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some Googling I came across people with similar issues, (including one
annoyingly paywalled RedHat article on the issue). Several people simply ended
the conversation on the assumption the user with the issue had been hacked.
Finally I &lt;a href="http://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos/2007-December/049222.html"&gt;came across one helpful individual&lt;/a&gt; with the fix. The binaries
just need to have their prelink cache updated again. This can be accomplished
with the following command on CentOS 6.5 (probably the same on others).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt;
  &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;/usr/sbin/prelink -av -mR
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update:&lt;/em&gt; Ultimately I decided to follow &lt;a href="/knowledge_base/linux/hardening/"&gt;my own advice&lt;/a&gt; (search for
prelink) and just simply disabled prelinking too prevent it from interferring
with aide checks and causing other weird issues. The memory trade-off isn&amp;#39;t
valuable enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">SPF &amp; DKIM Records in Route 53</title>
    <published>2014-07-30T14:46:13Z</published>
    <updated>2014-07-30T14:46:13Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://stelfox.net/blog/2014/07/spf-and-dkim-records-in-route-53/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to do a more detailed post on emailing from Amazon&amp;#39;s infrastructure
soon, but in the meantime I wanted to quickly throw out solutions too a couple
of problems I encountered. These are all specific too Amazon&amp;#39;s Route 53, and
most are user error (myself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SPF Invalid Characters or Format&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After generating my SPF record, I jumped into Route 53, created a new record
pasted in my record, attempted to save and received the following message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The record set could not be saved because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Value field contains invalid characters or is in an invalid format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was using the SPF record type at a time (see the next section) and assumed
that I had messed up the format of my record in some way. I banged my head
against the wall and through RFCs thoroughly before I found the solution...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solution: Wrap your SPF records in quotation characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;No SPF Record Found / Validation Failure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I have my DMARC policy in place (I&amp;#39;ll cover this in my email follow up),
I receive daily domain reports from Google whenever something fails validation
about my domain. After switching to Route 53 for DNS the &lt;code&gt;authresult&lt;/code&gt; component
started showing up as fail for SPF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing around a few online SPF validators indicated that none of them were
able to see my new SPF record, and there had been plenty of time for it too
propagate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SPF resource record type (RRTYPE 99) is available in Route 53 even though
&lt;a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6686#section-3.1"&gt;the record type has been deprecated&lt;/a&gt;. Not being familiar with this
particular decision, I assumed I should be using it &lt;em&gt;instead&lt;/em&gt; of the TXT record
I&amp;#39;ve used for every other domain, and it would be handled correctly or more
intelligently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solution: Either switch the SPF record too a TXT record. or my preference
duplicate it into a TXT record so you have both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Invalid DKIM record&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one had me scratching my head for a while. This was my first time
deploying DKIM on a domain that I was not running a Bind name server for.
OpenDKIM is nice enough too generate a Bind record for you which works
perfectly. It&amp;#39;s output looks like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt;
  &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;default._domainkey.example.tld.   IN      TXT     ( &amp;quot;v=DKIM1; k=rsa; t=y; s=email; &amp;quot;
          &amp;quot;p=MIHfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4HNADCByQKBwQC2Cwpa/+Xhfkzn0QnyQoxRwoJPb+s51dIt9UtFLMlMFuYa/k3GBwZ7UWeyAaQJ3RibSzKV/YwgFuMrzyISrLNSuL2k1bQlQQG8nl23Mu9Mowcb+mV2/3G7roshK6kOLNA0IV2SBl8/0UoNZR/x7c1lzVtVqdj0vW1SsJzgGfbt4LGRvCPyjdg+SLpYtOd/Li4Y1pvHgSRKQRrklpKeJo&amp;quot;
          &amp;quot;nJQ4+lXWqzYtuX9xdNH46ck2HUl56Ob4cy3/gYCJBWrAsCAwEAAQ==&amp;quot; )  ; ----- DKIM key default for example.tld
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copying and pasting everything between the parens in the value field and
pasting them into Route 53 works flawlessly. The catch? This won&amp;#39;t be treated
as a single record, but three individual responses. None of which are complete
and valid DKIM records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This happens because Route 53&amp;#39;s value field treats newlines as separate
records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solution: Turn it into one long string so it isn&amp;#39;t covering multiple lines
right? Not quite...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TXTRDATATooLong&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining the DKIM key into one string like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt;
  &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;quot;v=DKIM1; k=rsa; t=y; s=email; p=MIHfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4HNADCByQKBwQC2Cwpa/+Xhfkzn0QnyQoxRwoJPb+s51dIt9UtFLMlMFuYa/k3GBwZ7UWeyAaQJ3RibSzKV/YwgFuMrzyISrLNSuL2k1bQlQQG8nl23Mu9Mowcb+mV2/3G7roshK6kOLNA0IV2SBl8/0UoNZR/x7c1lzVtVqdj0vW1SsJzgGfbt4LGRvCPyjdg+SLpYtOd/Li4Y1pvHgSRKQRrklpKeJonJQ4+lXWqzYtuX9xdNH46ck2HUl56Ob4cy3/gYCJBWrAsCAwEAAQ==&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And attempting to save results in the following error message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invalid Resource Record: FATAL problem: TXTRDATATooLong encountered at ...&lt;snip&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we&amp;#39;re left in a tricky spot. After some research the reason behind this is
clear, and makes sense. Though it is another poor usability bug in the way
Amazon&amp;#39;s Route 53 behaves. Individual DNS UDP packets are limited too 255
characters for their response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too properly deliver records longer than that DNS servers are supposed to break
up the response into chunks. Properly implemented clients combine these chunks
together (with no spaces, newlines or other characters added). What this means
is that the record can be broken up transparently behind the scenes anywhere in
the message and the client will put it back together correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Route 53 entry form won&amp;#39;t handle this for you though, and in hindsight it
looks like Bind might not do it for you though I suspected that was more for
readability of zone files rather than a technical limitation (and I haven&amp;#39;t
tested whether Bind is intelligent enough too handle just a long string).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solution: Take the original output of Bind between the parens and just remove
the newline characters, leave the quotation marks and spaces between the
sections like the following sample and you&amp;#39;ll be golden:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt;
  &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;quot;v=DKIM1; k=rsa; t=y; s=email; &amp;quot; &amp;quot;p=MIHfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4HNADCByQKBwQC2Cwpa/+Xhfkzn0QnyQoxRwoJPb+s51dIt9UtFLMlMFuYa/k3GBwZ7UWeyAaQJ3RibSzKV/YwgFuMrzyISrLNSuL2k1bQlQQG8nl23Mu9Mowcb+mV2/3G7roshK6kOLNA0IV2SBl8/0UoNZR/x7c1lzVtVqdj0vW1SsJzgGfbt4LGRvCPyjdg+SLpYtOd/Li4Y1pvHgSRKQRrklpKeJo&amp;quot; &amp;quot;nJQ4+lXWqzYtuX9xdNH46ck2HUl56Ob4cy3/gYCJBWrAsCAwEAAQ==&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps someone else!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Unregistering From WhisperPush After Flashing a New ROM</title>
    <published>2014-07-23T01:54:59Z</published>
    <updated>2014-07-23T01:54:59Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://stelfox.net/blog/2014/07/unregistering-from-whisperpush-after-flashing-a-new-rom/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been playing around with my Nexus 5 lately. It was quickly rooted and I
began playing with various ROMs that had been pre-built for the Nexus 5. My
first stop was the &lt;a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/"&gt;CyanogenMod&lt;/a&gt;. Since I&amp;#39;d last used CyanogenMod they added
a built-in framework that provides &lt;a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/cyanogen-integration/"&gt;transparent text&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/blog/whisperpush-secure-messaging-integration"&gt;message
encryption&lt;/a&gt; called WhisperPush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WhisperPush is an implementation of &lt;a href="http://thoughtcrime.org/"&gt;Moxie Marlinspike&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; highly respected
TextSecure and I was very excited at the possibility of using it. I immediately
signed up for the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a day of use I found CyanogenMod far too unstable too use on my primary
device. It locked up multiple times the first day and mobile data simply
wouldn&amp;#39;t work all day. I promptly formatted and flashed my phone, I haven&amp;#39;t
settled on a new ROM but that&amp;#39;s not what this post is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me after flashing the phone I was still subscribed to
WhisperPush. If anyone that texts me was signed up as well. I&amp;#39;d never receive
even an encrypted blob, it would just silently fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Searching around I found there is very little information on it, and no
official way to unregister, especially after you&amp;#39;ve wiped your device and no
longer have your credentials. Ultimately I found a fairly easy solution, just
re-register and perform the backdoor steps too de-register.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wiped my phone again and installed a new copy of the CyanogenMod nightly.
Booted it up and re-enabled WhisperPush. It didn&amp;#39;t even note that my number was
registered in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the solution somewhere in the CyanogenMod forums (though I lost the
link, and I&amp;#39;m now too lazy to go find it again). You can unregister by
performing the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect your computer with ADB too the phone and pair the computer with the
phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable developer options by opening the system settings, choosing &amp;#39;About
phone&amp;#39; and clicking on the &amp;#39;Build number&amp;#39; about 7 times (it will start
counting down).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open up the developer options found in the root of the system settings menu
and enable root access for &amp;#39;Apps and ADB&amp;#39;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the computer use &lt;code&gt;adb shell&lt;/code&gt; to get a shell on the device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch to root using the &lt;code&gt;su&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run the following command too view the WhisperPush internal settings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt;
  &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;cat /data/user/0/org.whispersystems.whisperpush/shared_prefs/org.whispersystems.whisperpush_preferences.xml`
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note down the value for &lt;code&gt;pref_registered_number&lt;/code&gt; (this should be your phone
number with a preceeding &amp;#39;+&amp;#39;) and &lt;code&gt;pre_push_password&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exit the shell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally too unregister we need too make a DELETE request against the
WhisperPush API. The classic HTTP swiss army knife &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; is going to help us
on this front. Run the following command on any linux computer with curl
installed, replacing the registered number and registered password with the
value you recorded earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt;
  &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;curl -v -k -X DELETE --basic --user ${pref_registered_number}:${pre_push_password} https://whisperpush.cyanogenmod.org/v1/accounts/gcm
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure too include the &amp;#39;+&amp;#39; in your pref_registered_number. You should end up
with a status code of 204. The output will look something like the following
(credentials removed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt;
  &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;* About to connect() to whisperpush.cyanogenmod.org port 443 (#0)

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have any way too check that I&amp;#39;m unregistered but it seems too have
worked. Here is hoping this helps some else out in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Using OpenWRT's Dnsmasq as a TFTP Server</title>
    <published>2014-07-02T01:26:45Z</published>
    <updated>2014-07-02T01:26:45Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://stelfox.net/blog/2014/07/using-openwrts-dnsmasq-as-a-tftp-server/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently reflashed my primary router to a newer version of OpenWRT and
attempted to follow &lt;a href="/blog/2013/12/using-dnsmasq-as-a-standalone-tftp-server/"&gt;my own directions&lt;/a&gt; written in an earlier blog post to
add PXE booting to my local network using the dnsmasq service built in. After
following my advice I found that the dnsmasq service wasn&amp;#39;t starting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking into the &lt;code&gt;logread&lt;/code&gt; output I finally saw that this was due too a
permission issue. Combining this with the output of &lt;code&gt;ps&lt;/code&gt; too identify the user
that dnsmasq was running on I was able to both modify my instructions and use
OpenWRT&amp;#39;s own config system to perform the configuration instead of modifying
the dnsmasq configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First was solving the permissions issue. I created a dedicated directory at
&lt;code&gt;/var/tftp&lt;/code&gt; and changed the ownership to &amp;#39;nobody&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;nogroup&amp;#39; and mode too
&amp;#39;0755&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously I used &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/tftp&lt;/code&gt;, however, the default permissions on the
&lt;code&gt;/var/lib&lt;/code&gt; directory is too restrictive and I didn&amp;#39;t want to reduce the rest of
that directories security posture simply too allow directory traversal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up was getting the TFTP portion of dnsmasq configured and running. Open up
&lt;code&gt;/etc/config/dhcp&lt;/code&gt; and under the &amp;#39;dnsmasq&amp;#39; section add the following lines (or
if these lines already exist adjust the values to match).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt;
  &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  option enable_tftp '1'
  option tftp_root '/var/tftp'
  option dhcp_boot 'pxelinux.0'
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;uci commit dhcp&lt;/code&gt; too commit the changes and finally &lt;code&gt;/etc/init.d/dnsmasq
restart&lt;/code&gt; To apply the changes. You&amp;#39;ll want too put the &amp;#39;pxelinux.0&amp;#39; and
associated configuration files into the &lt;code&gt;/var/tftp&lt;/code&gt; directory too complete the
PXE booting configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll probably write a blog post covering my PXE setup and configuration if I
don&amp;#39;t get distracted by other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
