      <description>This is a very basic operation on a Linux system, but I have to interact with it so rarely since I run either chronyd or ntpd on all of machines. Occasionally, I find a device that needs a helping hand.
On a device with a known good time (or approximate enough):
date +%s This will get you the current unix timestamp. On the target system needing updating as root (replacing &amp;lt;unix timestamp&amp;gt; with the results from the last command):</description>

      <title>The Case of an Empty Executable</title>

      <description>I recently came across a short article written about a decade ago. It was a curious thing already as it was hosted in a user&amp;rsquo;s home directory off a webserver with the standard &amp;lsquo;~&amp;rsquo; showing up in the URL. The important part that caught my eye was this:
 The &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; program does nothing; it merely exits with a zero exit status. This can be done with an empty file that&amp;rsquo;s marked executable, and that&amp;rsquo;s what it was in the earliest unix system libraries.</description>

      <title>Auditd</title>

      <description>Auditd collects any configured syscall execution with critical security metadata associated with the event. This can help enrich other security tools such as AIDE to determine what user and process are responsible for the change.
For reliable operation the rules should be carefully tuned to your system. Tracking every write to disk will generate an unreasonable amount of events and depending on the configuration of the kernel&amp;rsquo;s audit subsystem, may trigger a kernel panic.</description>

      <description>AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) is a file and directory integrity checker that compares the current hashes, permissions, and attributes of files directories against a known database built from the system.
This can be run periodically to detect manipulation of critical system files, though a motivated attacker with an appropriate level of permissions could modify this database or disable the check as long as the system is able to write to it.</description>

      <description>Smart Card NEO dnf install ykpers -y ykpersonalize -m82  Unplug and replug it back in and it should be usable as a smartcard.
NFC / HTTP Auth dnf install ykpers -y ykpersonalize -n https://api.stelfox.net/sessions/yknfc?t=  This will hit the API with a URL like: https://api.stelfox.net/session/yknfc?t=ccccccuddclhrkuvurcufviveulljleihvreukifegjh
The API can then return a token that for accessing additional functionality.
Resetting This will wipe all keys, user, and admin pins on the card.</description>

      <description>I followed the TAILS setup guide to get a secure offline environment running to perform this generation task. The steps I took are documented in the tails document.
Initial Key Creation For simplicity I wanted to clear out the GnuPG configuration that starts out in place. Makes things a lot nicer later on.
rm -rf ~/.gnupg/*  I pulled in the .gnupg/gpg.conf from my dotfiles by hand.
And begin the key generation process</description>

      <description>This is a weird file&amp;hellip; But while installing gentoo on a disk I started getting a weird error when printing the current partitions on the drive:
Warning: The driver descriptor says the physical block size is 2048 bytes, but Linux says it is 512 bytes.  The only thing I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to find anywhere about this is &amp;ldquo;a low-level device tool (like dd) wrote blocks at the wrong size directly onto the device&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>GRE encapsulates all layer 2 traffic, but does so through an unencrypted tunnel. Sensitive traffic should exclusively go through a lower level encrypted tunnel like IPSec.
Firewall The following iptables need to be enabled to allow the GRE traffic to and from the system. This should be restricted to / from IP addresses as well.
-A INPUT -p 47 -j ACCEPT -A OUTPUT -p 47 -j ACCEPT  Manual Setup I&amp;rsquo;ve seen several setups on the internet that make some&amp;hellip; Odd choices.</description>

      <description>Amanda, or the Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver is an open source computer archiving tool that is able to back up data residing on multiple computers on a network.
I am not a huge fan of having xinetd or perl on my system and this is reliant on both, however, there does not currently seem to be any reasonable open source alternatives that support managing a tape library.</description>

      <title>Better Practices With Sudo</title>
      <link>https://stelfox.net/blog/2016/02/better-practices-with-sudo/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I work with a lot of different linux machines from embedded devices, to cloud
servers and open stack hosts. For many of them I&amp;rsquo;m either the sole
administrator or one of three or less with administrative access. Where there
are multiple administrative users, we all are generally working as backups to
each other. We use sudo whenever we need to execute a task with privileges on
any of these machines with no direct root login permitted remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must confess I have established two habits over time that are against best
practices with regard to sudo; Using it to execute a root shell only, and not
restricting which commands can be run with sudo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
