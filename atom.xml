      <title>Investigating LVM From Dracut</title>

      <description>In my my last post, I covered finding logical volumes that were missing from LVM from within a live CD (which is effectively a whole standard environment). Working with dracut is quite a bit more limited.
Turns out that the commands I&amp;rsquo;m normally used to for operating and inspecting LVM volumes can all be accessed as a second parameter to the lvm tool like so:
$ lvm vgscan $ lvm pvscan $ lvm lvscan For my particular issue, it led me to notice that block device of my root filesystem was missing due to a missing kernel driver&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Visible Yet Missing Logical Volumes</title>

      <description>While working on an automated install script for an embedded board, I hit an issue with the logical volumes never showing up in /dev/mapper, and in turn unable to be mounted. This left me in the dracut emergency shell (after about three minutes), with little to go on beyond the following error:
[187.508531] dracut Warning: Could not boot. [187.510560] dracut Warning: /dev/disk/by-uuid/5681-902D does not exist [187.512534] dracut Warning: /dev/mapper/system-root does not exit [187.</description>

      <title>Server Naming Convention</title>

      <description>Over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself using many different naming schemes for servers under my control. I came across a naming convention that finally feels correct. That blog post is quite well written and will let it stand on its own. In the event it ever disappears the important bits (and those where I&amp;rsquo;ve personalized it) are included here.
There are ultimately two or three DNS names that each host receives.</description>

      <title>Vultr Deny All Firewall</title>

      <description>While setting up new instances on Vultr for testing, I wanted to initially ensure that no traffic beyond my own could touch the instances. After adding a matching rule for SSH to my IPv4 address, a default rule shows up that drops any unspecified traffic. Switching to the IPv6 I wanted to add a drop all rule (as I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be using IPv6 until the system was up).
The interface only allows accept rules to be created and additionally you&amp;rsquo;ll be greeted with this message while trying to figure out what to do:</description>

      <description>I keep a copy of my mutt config both here on the site as well as in my public dotfiles. Eventually I&amp;rsquo;ll likely document my reasoning, preferences and the tradeoffs made in that config (and change my mind on most in the process).
Vim Since I use vim as my editor I also added the following line to my vim configuration file to autowrap my lines at 72 characters, but only for mutt composed messsages.</description>

      <title>IPTables</title>

      <description>iptables (and ip6tables) is a simple application for interacting directly with the Linux kernel&amp;rsquo;s netfilter firewall. nftables is attempting to replace it. nftables has better performance but is incredibly complex and difficult to use. Until the tooling and usability around nftables is addressed iptables will likely remain the reigning champion.
It is important that your systems have effective ingress and egress rules. Depending on your host OS, you&amp;rsquo;ll find your rule set stored in different locations but the following list are where I&amp;rsquo;ve seen them before:</description>

      <title>Syslog-NG</title>

      <description>Syslog-NG is a fast, reliable, and secure syslog daemon that can do advanced processing and log centralization while maintaining a sane configuration file syntax. I&amp;rsquo;ve recently come to vastly prefer it over my previous long term favorite Rsyslog.
It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that when modifying the logs statements, they will be processed in order. This means log statements that finalize a message will never make it past that statement. This finalization behavior can be a great tool for optimizing the processing path of logs but can result in unexpected behavior if you don&amp;rsquo;t pay attention when re-ordering the statements.</description>

      <title>Security Principles</title>

      <description>While reviewing current security hardening practices put out by several organizations and attempting to filter the good recommendations from the outdated legislated requirements, I came across one of the best descriptions of basic security principles. You can find it in the NIST Guide to General Server Security (published in 2008).
I&amp;rsquo;ve replicated section 2.4 from the linked document (I have removed the footnotes, but it is otherwise unchanged) in its entirety here for safe keeping and to hopefully help expose this to more people.</description>

      <title>Linux Audit Rule Paths</title>

      <description>I encountered a little bit of confusion while rewriting my auditd rules which some Googling did not help me solve.
When monitoring a file or directory there are two forms the rules can take. They are effectively equivalent in their functionality. The simpler form is the following format:
-w /etc/shadow -p wa -w /boot -p wa -w /etc/dont_readme -p r  These three rules are all behaving slightly differently. The first will audit any writes or attribute changes to the shadow file.</description>

      <title>Vulnerable Smart Cards</title>

      <description>In addition to the WiFi vulnerability a much more limited vulnerability was announced around private GPG keys that were generated using Infineon&amp;rsquo;s RSA Library version v1.02.013.
The vulnerability lies in shortcuts taken to speed up the key generation using the library. The performance increase makes the private key vulnerable to factorization attacks using an extension to Coppersmith&amp;rsquo;s attack.
It has been confirmed that YubiKey 4s are effected as are many nations national ID cards.</description>
