      <title>Fixing Hung Nginx Workers</title>

      <description>While cleaning up some tech debt, a curious issue cropped up. Nginx was running in an alpine container as a front end load balancer. It had a dynamic config that got periodically updated by a sidecar, and had filebeat shipping logs out to a central collector but otherwise was just a very simple Nginx config.
Every now and then the container would crash, it would automatically recover fast enough no alarms were lost and the clients would just resend their requests.</description>

      <description>I recently began trying out Cinnamon as my desktop environment and I&amp;rsquo;ve been thoroughly enjoying it. The only issue I was having was occasionally a page&amp;rsquo;s form input fields would have a dark background while still having dark text making it impossible to read, and very difficult to write.
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t happening everywhere, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t track down what about a website would cause the issue. Most prominently for me was when this showed up in AWS&amp;rsquo;s interface.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time there was a single AWS account. In this AWS account was several regions but a single VPC. To make sure expansions into other regions was possible this VPC chose to use the largest private subnet which just so happened to also be the default (10.0.0.0/8).
Another AWS account enter the picture and while they were single they came to the same conclusion and followed the best practices and defaults to their heart&amp;rsquo;s content.</description>

      <description>One of the Cisco Catalyst 3750 I had to work on recently had it&amp;rsquo;s flash completely wiped. When this happens you can only flash the filesystem using the XMODEM serial console. This is a fairly well documented process on Windows. On Linux most of the documented ways involve switching between multiple utilities and can be tricky. I wanted to documented how I did this and possibly help other in the same situation.</description>

      <description>Sometimes it becomes important to understand how your cloud provider implements certain networking details. While working through an issue in AWS I needed to understand how they handle public IP addressing. While this issue for me was specific to an Elastic IP all of their public addresses are handled this way and may bite you even without them. The problems specifically crop up when a hosted piece of software does NAT traversal detection and changes it&amp;rsquo;s behavior based on the result.</description>

      <description>IPSec is a well known and well understood protocol that is pretty easy to get setup and going&amp;hellip; Most of the time. While setting up an IPSec tunnel to an AWS host I came across a new and unique experience that didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have an easily searchable solution.
I had two CentOS 7 EC2 instances, each set up with their own Elastic IP in a default VPC. I installed and configured libreswan with the following config:</description>

      <title>Hosting Your Own Private Git Repo</title>

      <description>Git was built and developed with the intention of being a distributed reversion control system. Most people now use it with one or another central repository even when working on large teams which is perfectly fine if that model works for you and your team.
It can be useful to quickly work with others on private repositories without requiring them to get on your platform of choice, or for sensitive repositories keep the repository entirely under your control.</description>

      <title>Performance Impact of OpenVPN Port Sharing</title>

      <description>I recently had cause to use OpenVPN on the standard HTTPS port to protect my traffic. This was done as a compromise with administrators who didn&amp;rsquo;t want to change their egress filtering, but wanted to allow me to continue doing my normal work.
I already run several webservers, including this one, and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to give up exclusive access to the precious TCP port 443. The recommended way to deal with this is to make use of the port-share option built into OpenVPN.</description>

      <description>DNS-over-TLS is a relatively new privacy enhancing protocol that encrypts all of your DNS requests to a trusted server. In an age when airports, and coffee shops are outsourcing &amp;lsquo;free wifi&amp;rsquo; to corporate entities that are likely harvesting as much data as they can this is a nice addition. I largely use VPNs when connected to these access points which provides at least as good protection as DNS-over-TLS which has caused me to largely overlook this development.</description>

      <description>While working on a replacement webserver, I encountered some odd behavior which took a bit to track down to CloudFlare. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a bug or an issue with CloudFlare, it was just unexpected.
The server was configured to respond to www.example.tld as well as example.tld, to both encrypted and unencrypted connections. Any requests to the www. domain get redirected to https://example.tld. The config was roughly:
server { listen 80; listen [::]:80; listen 443 ssl http2; listen [::]:443 ssl http2; server_name www.</description>

      <description>This last Thursday I had the privilege of giving a talk at our local Linux User Group about diagnosing firewall issues on Linux entitled &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s Never the Firewall: Diagnosing Linux Firewall Issues&amp;rdquo;. I really enjoyed giving the talk, however, I left a few questions unanswered. While I may do a more extensive post on everything that I went through in the talk (I have been lax on writing content for this blog), this post is more to answer the outstanding questions and of course to make my slides available.</description>

      <description>Route53 doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow multiple definitions of the same name/type pair of DNS entries which is quite a headache. This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve had a conflict of a TXT record in Route53 at the base, specifically both Google&amp;rsquo;s site verification, and SPF records both want to live at the root of the domain. The site verification record needs to stay around as Google periodically re-verifies the domain.
To get this to work you need to quote both the Google verification string and the SPF record, but you also have to ensure that there is a newline in the field.</description>

      <description>I have the privilege of working full remote. To stay connected with our other remote workers and the main office we keep a live video conference going all the time. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty convenient and definitely allows me to continue to feel connected with the company.
During one of our stand ups, a coworker mentioned that they&amp;rsquo;d like to see how things looked over time. I have three 1440p monitors and largely leave the video conference on my right most window, which makes recording (an audio free) timelapse pretty easy with FFmpeg.</description>

      <description>Normally handling HTTP responses in Ruby is rather straight forward. There is a native library in Ruby that handles HTTP requests which parses the responses into a neat data structure that you can then operate on. What if you want to work on stored HTTP responses outside of a connection though? This was the situation I found myself in and thanks to a series of unusual decisions in the Ruby core library I found myself left out in the cold.</description>

      <description>I regularly find myself inspecting traffic on Linux systems. Usually I&amp;rsquo;m already on the client or server when doing this (such as when diagnosing weird low level app behavior, or unknown, or unusual traffic). It has been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve needed to silently be the wire between two black boxes.
While verifying link level information about bypassing my Google Fiber Network Box I needed to be that wire again. Before I connected any wires to anything I needed to be sure I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t accidentally leak traffic as I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what would impact the link.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing software to work against an OpenLDAP instance, with a highly customized schema. The operators of the existing system only had the schema files and searching around found several elaborate ways to convert the files which I tried with mixed success. After doing the research to figure this out, it became clear I could probably have used slapcat and have dumped the active schema directly to LDIF.
As a sample of how I converted these, I&amp;rsquo;ll use the rfc2307bis.</description>

      <description>While setting up and OpenLDAP server I found my distribution shipped with a couple of schema files, but no equivalent LDIF files. I found ways to convert the file using slapcat and slaptest and the files were valid on their own.
I was specifically trying to bootstrap an OpenLDAP server, with it&amp;rsquo;s schema, from scratch for a CI/CD system to test against. To accomplish this I was making use of the include directive in a configuration LDIF file and saw some very odd behavior.</description>

      <description>Note: If you&amp;rsquo;ve come here looking to build a root filesystem for 32 bit ARM devices I suspect everything but the build tuple will be the same. The issues that need to be worked around largely packaging and profile issues that should all be the same.
I got a hold of a Zynq 7100 development board, and while I&amp;rsquo;ve played with some embedded ARM microcontrollers such as the STM32F3 series and more basic RISC style microcontrollers like Atmel&amp;rsquo;s SAMD10 and Atmega lines, I&amp;rsquo;ve never played with FPGA development before so I considered this an interesting learning opportunity.</description>

      <description>I needed to convert a directory full of CPIO files to tar balls. This quick script did the trick for me but didn&amp;rsquo;t preserve the user / group. Running it as root will preserve the ownership information but that wasn&amp;rsquo;t important for my immediate use case.

      <description>I use a Yubikey NEO to store subkeys used for signing and authentication. I started experiencing a weird issue with it. It coincided with me rebuilding my system so diagnosing it ended up being harder than normal. The behavior I experienced allowed me to use the key to authenticate (SSH&amp;rsquo;ing worked fine) but any attempt to sign new data resulted in an &amp;lsquo;Unusuable secret key&amp;rsquo; error. For git this resulted in the following message:</description>

      <description>While trying to build up a minimal Gentoo graphical environment I kept running into an error every time I logged into XFCE from lightdm (I didn&amp;rsquo;t try starting up XFCE any other way). There are tons of blog posts that relate to systemd, ubuntu, or crouton but none related to Gentoo.
The first error message that pops up is:
Unable to contact settings server Failed to connect to socket /tmp/dbus-xxxxxxxxx: Connection refused  Once you click through there was a second error message, but I believe it was due to the previous error and not actually an issue:</description>

The behavior of the keyboard was also odd, it would toggle it&amp;rsquo;s numlock light every couple of button presses.
Once again this was an issue that was hard to search for, and most other people asking it seemed to only get snarky non-answers which seem so prevalent in forums.</description>

      <description>While refining some automated setup scripts at some point I upgraded to a testing/unstable version of glibc. When I attempted to get the box back on to the stable version I hit a solid protection mechanism built into the portage scripts that prevents downgrading glibc. Attempts will give you the following error message:
 * Sanity check to keep you from breaking your system: * Downgrading glibc is not supported and a sure way to destruction * ERROR: sys-libs/glibc-2.</description>

      <description>I have been recently attempting to cross compile a custom Gentoo profile targetting a Xilinx board as I found their distribution to be unmanageable (PetaLinux as hacked together sub-distro of Yocto). I had several issues with the default profile (embedded) conflicting with other critical packages. I&amp;rsquo;ll do a detailed post later on for building that entire root filesystem.
I came across one issue which didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have a well-documented solution.</description>

      <description>I use Gentoo with OpenRC quite a bit both for my personal servers and as a compilation test bed for new software since I can control the dependency versions very tightly. I have a set of scripts I&amp;rsquo;ve been using for quite some time that handle setting up a hardened, fairly minimal install.
I recently encountered a weird issue with them that resulted in an esoteric error that prevented my host from fully booting and leaving the root filesystem read-only.</description>

      <description>Cron is a pretty standard utility and there isn&amp;rsquo;t much to it. I generally use cronie as my cron daemon with the associated anacron. Cron runs tasks periodically, and anacron helps ensure that a missed task will get run if it was off or powercycled when it would have otherwise run.
File Format The config format differs slightly between crontabs, regular cron files, and anacron entries. At the beginning of all the files environment variables can be set using key=value pairs to control the behavior of cron and anacron followed by entries for that file one to a line.</description>

      <description>Syslog-NG is a fast, reliable, and secure syslog daemon that can do advanced processing and log centralization while maintaining a sane configuration file syntax. I&amp;rsquo;ve recently come to vastly prefer it over my previous long term favorite Rsyslog.
It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that when modifying the logs statements, they will be processed in order. This means log statements that finalize a message will never make it past that statement. This finalization behavior can be a great tool for optimizing the processing path of logs but can result in unexpected behavior if you don&amp;rsquo;t pay attention when re-ordering the statements.</description>

      <description>CFSSL is a toolkit of utilities for TLS PKI infrastructures and supports more functionality than I&amp;rsquo;ve personally needed. It is a fast and convenient way to setup and manage a multi-layer internal certificate authority.
I&amp;rsquo;ve used it to generate an internal root CA, with sub-CAs for internal only server certificates, and separate CAs for each domain of client certificates (such as VPN, log, mail, and LDAP servers). This allows the root CA to be protected more stringently than specific domains.</description>

      <description>In my my last post, I covered finding logical volumes that were missing from LVM from within a live CD (which is effectively a whole standard environment). Working with dracut is quite a bit more limited.
Turns out that the commands I&amp;rsquo;m normally used to for operating and inspecting LVM volumes can all be accessed as a second parameter to the lvm tool like so:
$ lvm vgscan $ lvm pvscan $ lvm lvscan For my particular issue, it led me to notice that block device of my root filesystem was missing due to a missing kernel driver&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>While working on an automated install script for an embedded board, I hit an issue with the logical volumes never showing up in /dev/mapper, and in turn unable to be mounted. This left me in the dracut emergency shell (after about three minutes), with little to go on beyond the following error:
[187.508531] dracut Warning: Could not boot. [187.510560] dracut Warning: /dev/disk/by-uuid/5681-902D does not exist [187.512534] dracut Warning: /dev/mapper/system-root does not exit [187.</description>

That blog post is quite well written and will let it stand on its own. In the event it ever disappears the important bits (and those where I&amp;rsquo;ve personalized it) are included here.
There are ultimately two or three DNS names that each host receives.</description>

      <description>While setting up new instances on Vultr for testing, I wanted to initially ensure that no traffic beyond my own could touch the instances. After adding a matching rule for SSH to my IPv4 address, a default rule shows up that drops any unspecified traffic. Switching to the IPv6 I wanted to add a drop all rule (as I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be using IPv6 until the system was up).
The interface only allows accept rules to be created and additionally you&amp;rsquo;ll be greeted with this message while trying to figure out what to do:</description>

      <description>iptables (and ip6tables) is a simple application for interacting directly with the Linux kernel&amp;rsquo;s netfilter firewall. nftables is attempting to replace it. nftables has better performance but is incredibly complex and difficult to use. Until the tooling and usability around nftables is addressed iptables will likely remain the reigning champion.
It is important that your systems have effective ingress and egress rules. Depending on your host OS, you&amp;rsquo;ll find your rule set stored in different locations but the following list are where I&amp;rsquo;ve seen them before:</description>

You can find it in the NIST Guide to General Server Security (published in 2008).
I&amp;rsquo;ve replicated section 2.4 from the linked document (I have removed the footnotes, but it is otherwise unchanged) in its entirety here for safe keeping and to hopefully help expose this to more people.</description>

      <description>I encountered a little bit of confusion while rewriting my auditd rules which some Googling did not help me solve.
When monitoring a file or directory there are two forms the rules can take. They are effectively equivalent in their functionality. The simpler form is the following format:
-w /etc/shadow -p wa -w /boot -p wa -w /etc/dont_readme -p r  These three rules are all behaving slightly differently. The first will audit any writes or attribute changes to the shadow file.</description>

      <description>In addition to the WiFi vulnerability a much more limited vulnerability was announced around private GPG keys that were generated using Infineon&amp;rsquo;s RSA Library version v1.02.013.
The vulnerability lies in shortcuts taken to speed up the key generation using the library. The performance increase makes the private key vulnerable to factorization attacks using an extension to Coppersmith&amp;rsquo;s attack.
It has been confirmed that YubiKey 4s are effected as are many nations national ID cards.</description>

 US-CERT has become aware of several key management vulnerabilities in the 4-way handshake of the Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) security protocol. The impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities includes decryption, packet replay, TCP connection hijacking, HTTP content injection, and others. Note that as protocol-level issues, most or all correct implementations of the standard will be affected.</description>

      <description>I recently came across a short article written about a decade ago. It was a curious thing already as it was hosted in a user&amp;rsquo;s home directory off a web server with the standard &amp;lsquo;~&amp;rsquo; showing up in the URL. The important part that caught my eye was this:
 The &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; program does nothing; it merely exits with a zero exit status. This can be done with an empty file that&amp;rsquo;s marked executable, and that&amp;rsquo;s what it was in the earliest unix system libraries.</description>

      <description>Auditd collects any configured syscall execution with critical security metadata associated with the event. This can help enrich other security tools such as AIDE to determine what user and process are responsible for the change.
For reliable operation the rules should be carefully tuned to your system. Tracking every write to disk will generate an unreasonable amount of events and depending on the configuration of the kernel&amp;rsquo;s audit subsystem, may trigger a kernel panic.</description>

      <description>AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) is a file and directory integrity checker that compares the current hashes, permissions, and attributes of files directories against a known database built from the system.
This can be run periodically to detect manipulation of critical system files, though a motivated attacker with an appropriate level of permissions could modify this database or disable the check as long as the system is able to write to it.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I work with a lot of different linux machines from embedded devices, to cloud
servers and open stack hosts. For many of them I&amp;rsquo;m either the sole
administrator or one of three or less with administrative access. Where there
are multiple administrative users, we all are generally working as backups to
each other. We use sudo whenever we need to execute a task with privileges on
any of these machines with no direct root login permitted remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must confess I have established two habits over time that are against best
practices with regard to sudo; Using it to execute a root shell only, and not
restricting which commands can be run with sudo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

My first stop was the CyanogenMod. Since I&amp;rsquo;d last used CyanogenMod they added a built-in framework that provides transparent text message encryption called WhisperPush.
WhisperPush is an implementation of Moxie Marlinspike&amp;rsquo;s highly respected TextSecure and I was very excited at the possibility of using it.</description>

      <description>I recently reflashed my primary router to a newer version of OpenWRT and attempted to follow my own directions written in an earlier blog post to add PXE booting to my local network using the dnsmasq service built in. After following my advice I found that the dnsmasq service wasn&amp;rsquo;t starting.
Looking into the logread output I finally saw that this was due too a permission issue. Combining this with the output of ps too identify the user that dnsmasq was running on I was able to both modify my instructions and use OpenWRT&amp;rsquo;s own configuration system to perform the configuration instead of modifying the dnsmasq configuration.</description>

      <description>I randomly started experiencing an issue with one blade in one of my PowerEdge C6100 blades. It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t obey all commands issued too it via IPMI or through the BMC&amp;rsquo;s web interface. Additionally the blade would randomly power on when off, and the front light would consistently blink as if a hardware fault was detected.
This has been bothering me for a while, but it was my spare blade and wasn&amp;rsquo;t affecting my lab in anyway so I&amp;rsquo;ve ignored it.</description>

      <description>The current large project I&amp;rsquo;m working on is going to be hosted on AWS and I was requested to do a cost estimate. Looking into it, it quickly became clear that reserved instances could potentially save quite a bit of cash but there was a catch (isn&amp;rsquo;t there always?).
There is an upfront cost for reserving the instance and in exchange you get a reduced hourly rate. After running the numbers one thing wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear too me, is the upfront cost credit towards running machines or a fee you never see again?</description>

      <description>Before I describe the issue that I encountered, let me be very clear. This hack is potentially dangerous and should absolutely only be done in development environments. This won&amp;rsquo;t affect your host system, only the docker container so the most damage you&amp;rsquo;ll do is prevent hostname and possibly user/group lookups within the container itself.
Alright with that out of the way, I was actively working on a codebase that uses subdomains as part of the identifier.</description>

Most of the markdown syntax can be stripped out simply by removing all non-alphanumeric characters from the document and move on. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t solve one of the bigger challenges I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced&amp;hellip; Code blocks.</description>

It seems that while Rails 4 supports the HStore datatype, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t enable the extension itself. I&amp;rsquo;ve found two ways too solve this issue in wildly different ways.
First Solution: Enable HStore by Default This is the common solution that is recommended too solve this issue.</description>

      <description>I regularly find myself working on projects that involve the manipulation and storage of RSA keys. In the past I&amp;rsquo;ve never had to worry about identification or presentation of these keys. Normally I&amp;rsquo;ve only got one too three pairs at most that I&amp;rsquo;m manipulating (server, certificate authority, client).
I&amp;rsquo;ve not found myself working on a project that involves presenting the certificates to users for selection and comparison. The obvious way too do this is take a page out of other developer&amp;rsquo;s books and present the key&amp;rsquo;s fingerprint.</description>

      <description>Anyone that has used SSH, Tmux or Screen for a while will have inevitably dumped excessive output to their terminal. Depending on the size of the output you may have experienced the dreaded lockup. That horrible realization seconds after you hit the command where signals just stop working and you just have to sit there and wait for your terminal to catch up.
There is a piece of remote connection software called Mosh that I&amp;rsquo;ve been told handles this pretty well, but I don&amp;rsquo;t yet trust its security model and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent the same thing from happening locally.</description>

For those not familiar with the ObjectSpace module, it is a means to inspect and access the items being tracked by Ruby&amp;rsquo;s garbage collector. This means it has a hook into every living object, and more dangerously, every near-death object.</description>

      <description>I needed to generate crypt-style SHA512 passwords in ruby for an /etc/shadow file. After a bunch of Googling and messing around with the OpenSSL library I finally found a very simple built-in way to handle this.
require &amp;#39;securerandom&amp;#39; &amp;#39;password&amp;#39;.crypt(&amp;#39;$6$&amp;#39; + SecureRandom.random_number(36 ** 8).to_s(36)) You&amp;rsquo;ll get a string that looks like:
$6$4dksjo1b$Lt194Dwy7r/7WbM8MezYZysmGcxjaiisgTrTBbHkyBZFXeqQTG0J5hep4wLM/AmYxlGNLRy0OWATLDZCqjwCk.  If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to use the SecureRandom module you can replace the random call with simply rand(36 ** 8) though this isn&amp;rsquo;t recommended.</description>

The system timezone is controlled by the /etc/localtime file and is generally symlinked to locale files stored in /usr/share/zoneinfo. Generally I like to keep my systems on UTC as I my machines are in several timezones and it makes all the logs have consistent times.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that this isn&amp;rsquo;t a guide on setting up PXE booting completely on an OpenWRT, you&amp;rsquo;ll need another system that is running a configured TFTP server.</description>

Now if only Google let you download everything they know about you as well&amp;hellip; Would definitely make for an interesting read.</description>

A lot of these are simply too heavy for me, involve installing software on a computer to access in addition to sharing the file around, or required you to remember multiple account details before you could get access to any individual password.
Due too the various complexities and lack of matching use cases a couple years ago I set out to develop my own open-source version of PassPack.</description>

      <description>This morning I found myself in need of a large set of emails to test a particular set of code. Ideally these emails would be broken out into easily digestible pieces, and it was strictly for my own personal testing so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t concerned with using my own live data for this test (There will probably be another post on this project later on).
Having used fetchmail with good results in the past I decided it was a good idea to take this opportunity to also backup my Gmail account into the common Maildir format (which essentially breaks out emails into individual files meeting my requirements).</description>

      <title>Ruby&#39;s Option Parser - a More Complete Example</title>

      <description>Recently while writing a Ruby program I needed to parse some command line options. Helpfully Ruby provides a module named OptionParser to make this easy. I found a few parts of the documentation ambiguous and a few others down right confusing.
The catch I hit was the required field. In my mind the definition of a required argument is something that needs to be passed on the command line to continue.</description>

      <description>I recently went back through my backups recently and found quite a few old abandoned projects. Looking back on the code I see some things I&amp;rsquo;m impressed with, but the majority of the code I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t write today. That&amp;rsquo;s not to say the code is bad, or doesn&amp;rsquo;t function. It did exactly what I wanted to accomplish at the time, just not necessarily in the most efficient way.
This archive of old code made me start wondering how much old code I&amp;rsquo;m using in the projects that I&amp;rsquo;m currently writing.</description>

      <description>A good friend of mine recently left the organization I work for and the task of resetting our passwords and auditing credentials fell on me. Since we use Heroku for our development platform I needed to not only reset the credentials for the web portion (which conveniently also handles resetting the API key) but also revoke any SSH keys he may have added to access it.
Sadly Heroku does not seem to provide any web interface that I could find for examining what keys were associated with the account.</description>

      <description>This is going to be a real quick post. I&amp;rsquo;m using the &amp;ldquo;carrier_wave&amp;rdquo; gem with &amp;ldquo;fog&amp;rdquo; for one of my projects and found that when a file is stored on S3 the &amp;ldquo;identifier&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;filename&amp;rdquo; methods return nil. I got around this issue in two separate ways neither of which I&amp;rsquo;m particularly happy about.
Outside of the uploader, you can use the File utility and the URL of the object to get the base filename like so:</description>

      <description>Jeremy Spilman recently proposed changes to how user&amp;rsquo;s hashes are stored in website&amp;rsquo;s and companies databases. This post was originally going to look at some of the issues involved in the scheme he envisioned, however, he rather quickly posted a followup article with a well thought out solution that countered all of the issues that other people and myself were able to come up with. I&amp;rsquo;d strongly recommend reading both if you haven&amp;rsquo;t done so.</description>

      <description>So I recently encountered a situation where I needed to define a prefix on the tables used by the &amp;ldquo;data_mapper&amp;rdquo; gem. When I went searching I found quite a bit of information about similar projects in Python, and PHP named DataMapper but nothing about the ruby &amp;ldquo;data_mapper&amp;rdquo;. The search continued eventually ending in my reading through the source of the data_mapper gem only to find that there was no feature for simply defining a prefix.</description>

      <description>I setup IPv6 on my home network with an OpenWRT router and Hurricane Electric and now I suddenly have an opinion on the state of IPv6 security. This is something that I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to do for some time and have been mulling over in the back of my mind. I&amp;rsquo;ll go over the details from start to finish of setting up hurricane electric on the router in another post as the information to do so is very scattered and disjointed.</description>

      <description>For the past few days I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a Ruby project that needed to interact with a remote XMLRPC API. This isn&amp;rsquo;t particularly unusual but it was the first time from within a Ruby application. Luckily enough Ruby has a built in XMLRPC client that handles a lot of the messy bits.
The XMLRPC::Client class itself seems fairly simple. There are only a handful of methods, five of which are for opening a new connection in a few different ways, and at least two ways to open each type of connection.</description>

      <description>So I found a dirt cheap video SIP phone (ACN Iris 3000) at a local HAM fest. After looking around I found the vendor has locked in the phone with their specific service with an iron grip and had gone out of business. I guess I should expect that kind of anti-competitive behavior from a business that Donald Trump has a vested interest in.
I&amp;rsquo;ve come across one post on a forum that seems to have been crawled and copied out every where.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m pleasantly surprised with hows it&amp;rsquo;s working everything seems to be working out the box very stably. I used it without issue for a solid month and a half without a single issue.
Earlier this week I started having issues with my wireless card on some networks, but not at all of them.</description>

      <description>One of the hot-topics for IPv6 (which I have been thinking about a lot lately) is NAT. I normally wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go into detail about specifics that are obvious to people in my field but for the sake of this post I will. NAT or Network Address Translation, is a way for a large number of computers to share a single public IP address.
The router that is handling the NAT will keep track of connections coming in and out of it and re-write the destination IP to an internal address to keep the traffic flowing.</description>

I let my crawler go and stopped it after a 24 hour period. I ran ls on the directory the images were being saved in to see the results and my ssh session locked up&amp;hellip; Or so I thought. I hit Ctrl-C and nothing happened&amp;hellip; So I closed my window and opened a new one.</description>

Asterisk is a software implementation of a telephone private branch exchange (PBX) originally created in 1999 by Mark Spencer of Digium. Like any PBX, it allows attached telephones to make calls to one another, and to connect to other telephone services including the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services.</description>

      <description>Recovering Data from Swap Sometimes useful bits of information can be recovered from swap. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s encryption keys, documents that were being worked on or anything else that might&amp;rsquo;ve ended up in RAM. To search through the swap for interesting bits (and depending on the size this might take a while) you can execute the following command as root or sudo to do it:
[root@localhost ~]# strings `/bin/swapon -s | tail -1 | awk &#39;{print $1}&#39;` | less  The command above uses the swapon utility to list all of the swap devices in use; look at the last line of the output (most people only have one swap device); extract only the path to the device node.</description>

I personally want to use public / private key pairs for my backups and contrary with what I do most of the time I share a single public / private key pair for my backups, with a strong pass string on the private key.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve already implemented the SSH keys for authentication and have a password on your key then you&amp;rsquo;ve already achieved multi-factor authentication to a certain degree.
The gatekeeper script is something that I haven&amp;rsquo;t come across on any other systems that other people administer. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s too much trouble for them without much gain. I had the idea for this while watching a James Bond movie.
A Russian systems engineer put riddles on one of his machines that you had to go through in order to access the system, while this alone isn&amp;rsquo;t secure, asking the user random questions after authentication couldn&amp;rsquo;t hurt security.</description>

It properly modernizes it and gives it all the stuff the nagios developers made into an &amp;ldquo;Enterprise only&amp;rdquo; release just to be tool bags. Unfortunately at this time there aren&amp;rsquo;t any handy Fedora packages, but this should be coming soon with any luck.</description>

Red Hat Based Systems Simple Static IP Address You&amp;rsquo;ll need to find the interface name of your primary ethernet card. Generally this can be done with the ipaddr show command. The device name will more likely than not be either eth0 or em1, though occasionally I&amp;rsquo;ve seen ethernet addresses along the lines of p12p1 (which is a terrible naming convention that bothers the hell out of me but I understand why the linux developers switched to this naming convention).</description>
