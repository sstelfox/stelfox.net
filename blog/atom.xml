      <title>AWS Elastic IP Details</title>

      <description>Sometimes it becomes important to understand how your cloud provider implements certain networking details. While working through an issue in AWS I needed to understand how they handle public IP addressing. While this issue for me was specific to an Elastic IP all of their public addresses are handled this way and may bite you even without them. The problems specifically crop up when a hosted piece of software does NAT traversal detection and changes it&amp;rsquo;s behavior based on the result.</description>

      <title>Fighting IPSec on AWS</title>

      <description>IPSec is a well known and well understood protocol that is pretty easy to get setup and going&amp;hellip; Most of the time. While setting up an IPSec tunnel to an AWS host I came across a new and unique experience that didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have an easily searchable solution.
I had two CentOS 7 EC2 instances, each set up with their own Elastic IP in a default VPC. I installed and configured libreswan with the following config:</description>

      <title>Hosting Your Own Private Git Repo</title>

      <description>Git was built and developed with the intention of being a distributed reversion control system. Most people now use it with one or another central repository even when working on large teams which is perfectly fine if that model works for you and your team.
It can be useful to quickly work with others on private repositories without requiring them to get on your platform of choice, or for sensitive repositories keep the repository entirely under your control.</description>

      <title>Performance Impact of OpenVPN Port Sharing</title>

      <description>I recently had cause to use OpenVPN on the standard HTTPS port to protect my traffic. This was done as a compromise with administrators who didn&amp;rsquo;t want to change their egress filtering, but wanted to allow me to continue doing my normal work.
I already run several webservers, including this one, and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to give up exclusive access to the precious TCP port 443. The recommended way to deal with this is to make use of the port-share option built into OpenVPN.</description>

      <title>Run Your Own DNS-over-TLS Server</title>

      <description>DNS-over-TLS is a relatively new privacy enhancing protocol that encrypts all of your DNS requests to a trusted server. In an age when airports, and coffee shops are outsourcing &amp;lsquo;free wifi&amp;rsquo; to corporate entities that are likely harvesting as much data as they can this is a nice addition. I largely use VPNs when connected to these access points which provides at least as good protection as DNS-over-TLS which has caused me to largely overlook this development.</description>

      <title>Weird CloudFlare Behavior</title>
      <link>https://stelfox.net/blog/2018/10/weird-cloudflare-behavior/</link>

      <description>While working on a replacement webserver, I encountered some odd behavior which took a bit to track down to CloudFlare. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a bug or an issue with CloudFlare, it was just unexpected.
The server was configured to respond to www.example.tld as well as example.tld, to both encrypted and unencrypted connections. Any requests to the www. domain get redirected to https://example.tld. The config was roughly:
server { listen 80; listen [::]:80; listen 443 ssl http2; listen [::]:443 ssl http2; server_name www.</description>

      <title>It&#39;s Never the Firewall</title>

      <description>This last Thursday I had the privilege of giving a talk at our local Linux User Group about diagnosing firewall issues on Linux entitled &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s Never the Firewall: Diagnosing Linux Firewall Issues&amp;rdquo;. I really enjoyed giving the talk, however, I left a few questions unanswered. While I may do a more extensive post on everything that I went through in the talk (I have been lax on writing content for this blog), this post is more to answer the outstanding questions and of course to make my slides available.</description>

      <title>SPF and Google Site Verification in Route 53</title>
      <link>https://stelfox.net/blog/2018/06/spf-and-google-site-verification-in-route-53/</link>

      <description>Route53 doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow multiple definitions of the same name/type pair of DNS entries which is quite a headache. This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve had a conflict of a TXT record in Route53 at the base, specifically both Google&amp;rsquo;s site verification, and SPF records both want to live at the root of the domain. The site verification record needs to stay around as Google periodically re-verifies the domain.
To get this to work you need to quote both the Google verification string and the SPF record, but you also have to ensure that there is a newline in the field.</description>

      <title>Timelapse of a Linux Desktop</title>

      <description>I have the privilege of working full remote. To stay connected with our other remote workers and the main office we keep a live video conference going all the time. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty convenient and definitely allows me to continue to feel connected with the company.
During one of our stand ups, a coworker mentioned that they&amp;rsquo;d like to see how things looked over time. I have three 1440p monitors and largely leave the video conference on my right most window, which makes recording (an audio free) timelapse pretty easy with FFmpeg.</description>

      <title>Parsing HTTP Responses in Ruby</title>

      <description>Normally handling HTTP responses in Ruby is rather straight forward. There is a native library in Ruby that handles HTTP requests which parses the responses into a neat data structure that you can then operate on. What if you want to work on stored HTTP responses outside of a connection though? This was the situation I found myself in and thanks to a series of unusual decisions in the Ruby core library I found myself left out in the cold.</description>
