        <div class="post-content">
          <p>I setup IPv6 on my home network with an OpenWRT router and Hurricane Electric
and now I suddenly have an opinion on the state of IPv6 security. This is
something that I've been meaning to do for some time and have been mulling over
in the back of my mind. I'll go over the details from start to finish of
setting up hurricane electric on the router in another post as the information
to do so is very scattered and disjointed. It does appear to be very well
documented on the OpenWRT wiki but I found that they leave out some very
important steps, so stay tuned for that.</p>

          <p>For the past few days I've been working on a Ruby project that needed to
interact with a remote XMLRPC API. This isn't particularly unusual but it was
the first time from within a Ruby application. Luckily enough Ruby has a built
in XMLRPC client that handles a lot of the messy bits.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>So I found a dirt cheap video SIP phone (ACN Iris 3000) at a local HAM fest.
After looking around I found the vendor has locked in the phone with their
specific service with an iron grip and had gone out of business. I guess I
should expect that kind of anti-competitive behavior from a business that
Donald Trump has a vested interest in.</p>

          <p>So I recently did a fresh install of Fedora 14 with KDE installed (not the KDE
spin mind you) on my ThinkPad. I'm pleasantly surprised with hows it's working
everything seems to be working out the box very stably. I used it without issue
for a solid month and a half without a single issue.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>One of the hot-topics for IPv6 (which I have been thinking about a lot lately)
is NAT. I normally wouldn't go into detail about specifics that are obvious to
people in my field but for the sake of this post I will. NAT or Network Address
Translation, is a way for a large number of computers to share a single public
IP address.</p>
