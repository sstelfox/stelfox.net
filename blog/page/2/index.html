          <p>Once upon a time there was a single AWS account. In this AWS account was
several regions but a single VPC. To make sure expansions into other regions
was possible this VPC chose to use the largest private subnet which just so
happened to also be the default (<code>10.0.0.0/8</code>).</p>

          <p>One of the Cisco Catalyst 3750 I had to work on recently had it's flash
completely wiped. When this happens you can only flash the filesystem using the
XMODEM serial console. This is a fairly well documented process on Windows. On
Linux most of the documented ways involve switching between multiple utilities
and can be tricky. I wanted to documented how I did this and possibly help
other in the same situation.</p>

          <p>Sometimes it becomes important to understand how your cloud provider implements
certain networking details. While working through an issue in AWS I needed to
understand how they handle public IP addressing. While this issue for me was
specific to an Elastic IP all of their public addresses are handled this way
and may bite you even without them. The problems specifically crop up when a
hosted piece of software does NAT traversal detection and changes it's behavior
based on the result.</p>

          <p>IPSec is a well known and well understood protocol that is pretty easy to get
setup and going... Most of the time. While setting up an IPSec tunnel to an AWS
host I came across a new and unique experience that didn't seem to have an
easily searchable solution.</p>

          <p>Git was built and developed with the intention of being a distributed reversion
control system. Most people now use it with one or another central repository
even when working on large teams which is perfectly fine if that model works
for you and your team.</p>
