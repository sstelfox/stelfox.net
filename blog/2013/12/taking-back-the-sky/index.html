article that was both concerning and very amusing. Drones have been getting
more and more popular, and more accessible. They&rsquo;ve been getting used by the
military, law enforcement, <a href=http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/02/tech/innovation/amazon-drones-questions/>recently Amazon</a> (though they&rsquo;ve abandoned that
for now), you can even purchase one for your iPhone at airports.</p><p>The security of these systems hasn&rsquo;t been thoroughly tested publicly, though
<a href=http://rt.com/news/iran-us-drone-gulf-216/>there is at least</a> one report of a military drone being stolen already.
With the beginnings of <a href=http://www.fastcompany.com/3019913/watch-the-skies-tonight-for-a-taco-delivering-drone-brought-to-you-by-taco-bell>various commercial uses</a> of drones, expanding beyond
hobbiests exploring <a href=http://gizmodo.com/5947033/this-team-of-quadrocopters-can-throw-and-catch-better-than-you>what they can do with them</a>.</p><p>Someone had to start the testing eventually and Samy Kamkar took the lead this
time with his new project <a href=http://samy.pl/skyjack/>Skyjack</a>. The article that tipped me off to this
project can be found <a href=http://threatpost.com/how-to-skyjack-drones-in-an-hour-for-less-than-400/103086>over on Threatpost</a>.</p><p>The gist of the project is a drone that can forcibly disconnect other drone&rsquo;s
controller and take it&rsquo;s place to &ldquo;steal&rdquo; the drone.</p><p>I can imagine a whole cyberpunk thriller action scene where corporate
anarchists hijack a drone and use it&rsquo;s trusted status within the drone&rsquo;s
network to hack in and take control of the entire CNC drone system to further
their goals.</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg>
