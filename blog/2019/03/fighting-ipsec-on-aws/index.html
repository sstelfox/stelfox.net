                <p>IPSec is a well known and well understood protocol that is pretty easy to get
setup and going&hellip; Most of the time. While setting up an IPSec tunnel to an AWS
host I came across a new and unique experience that didn&rsquo;t seem to have an
easily searchable solution.</p>
<p>I had two CentOS 7 EC2 instances, each set up with their own Elastic IP in a
default VPC. I installed and configured libreswan with the following config:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#c9d1d9;background-color:#0d1117;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>conn setup
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  protostack=netkey
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>conn site-tunnel
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  auto=start
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  pfs=yes
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  leftid=@left_tunnel_server_name
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  rightid=@right_tunnel_server_name
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  left=%defaultroute
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  right=&lt;remote-ip&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  authby=rsasig
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  leftrsasigkey=&lt;left-key&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  rightrsasigkey=&lt;right-key&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The IPSec link came up without issue but pings were timing out without a
response. When sniffing the incoming packets, I was appropriately seeing the
ICMP echo requests coming in encapsulated in the tunnel and being re-injected.
There was never a response being generated.</p>
<p>The traffic capture was also pretty clear as to why. The encapsulated packet
had the elastic IP as the destination which the EC2 instance doesn&rsquo;t
<em>ACTUALLY</em> have and wasn&rsquo;t aware&hellip; So it didn&rsquo;t attempt to respond.</p>
<p>I went down a bit of a rabbit hole attempting to get the instance to recognize
that address with limited success. Adding the IP to an additional loopback
interface&hellip; IPTables DNAT rules&hellip; Some of them worked but they were dirty
hacks that would have been left until something blew up&hellip;</p>
<p>The solution was simple and even improved the overall performance of the
link. By default libreswan operates in <code>tunnel</code> mode which sends along the
destination information as well (and can be used for routing network across).
For the use I almost always use these links for, <code>transport</code> is more
appropriate and has less protocol overhead.</p>
<p>By adding the following line to the connection configuration on both sides the
problem vanished:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#c9d1d9;background-color:#0d1117;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>  type=transport
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>With any luck the next person that comes across this issue will find this post
and their life will be a tad bit easier.</p>
