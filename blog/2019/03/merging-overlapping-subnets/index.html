In this AWS account was several regions but a single VPC. To make sure expansions into other regions was possible this VPC chose to use the largest private subnet which just so happened to also be the default ("10.0.0.0/8").</p><p>Another AWS account enter the picture and while they were single they came to the same conclusion and followed the best practices and defaults to their heart's content. Normally this wouldn't be a problem for either of them, but they found each other and tied the knot and were happily together for the rest of time...</p><p>But in this story there is a darkness looming. Communication was not everything either of them desired. There were secret things that couldn't be said in public forums of the internet but they both desperately wanted share. There was a solution... But it involved dark magic.</p><p>I found myself in a situation where two AWS VPCs needed to communicate sensitive data between the two, but they were using overlapping IP address spaces. There was a lot of room available in both, but even some individual IPs overlapped and renumbering would prove problematic and time consuming. Eventually these two VPCs were intended to be merged anyway, but business requirements needed a basic level of communication sooner.</p><p>The solution I came up with may be useful for others in a pinch; Two layers of 1:1 NAT were employed allowing each to communicate with what each side seemed to believe were unique IPs. To do this we need to have a usable IP address that we can map into without potentially wrecking havoc on access to random sites on the internet.</p><p>I was lucky in that all the hosts that need to talk to each other had addresses on both sides below "10.7.0.x". This is more addresses than are available to the "192.168.0.0/16" private address space but covers only about 25% of the "172.16.0.0/16" space. If you're in a worse situation where hosts are properly scattered all over the "10.0.0.0/8" address you can still use this technique but it will require a bit more manual configuration mapping allocating either /24 to route or in the most extreme case individual host addresses.</p><p>Before we go any further, I definitely consider this technique to be a band-aid for the issue. For longer term connectivity some form of migration should be planned and executed on. This makes a GREAT and stable band-aid though.</p><p>If you'd like to follow along you'll need two VPCs, each with two EC2 instances to work as the tunnel hosts and likely two more to be test hosts to make use of the tunnels.</p><p>This part is easy, we'll use CentOS 7 hosts as a base. You'll need to additionally install the following software:</p><ul><li>iptables-services</li><li>libreswan</li><li>tcpdump (optional but invaluable to diagnose issues)</li></ul><p>If you're not on AWS you'll also want to make sure that NetworkManager and firewalld are both <em><strong>removed from the system</strong></em>. They will break the configurations you put in place if left to their own machinations. If you remove NetworkManager remember to enable the network service. For good measure here is a minimal DHCP config you can use to configure <code>eth0</code> on your system:</p><div class=highlight><div class=chroma><table class=lntable><tr><td class=lntd><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code><span class=lnt id=hl-0-1><a class=lnlinks href=#hl-0-1>1</a>

</code></pre><p>Place the contents of that file in "/etc/sysconfig/iptables" as the header indicates. The differences from the default are mostly in that we have also defined the "nat" table and switched the default action on the "INPUT" and "FORWARD" chains to drop. Both the default and this one will reject the traffic anyways so this doesn't actually change the behavior of the firewall.</p><p>Defining the "nat" table doesn't change any behavior either, but I'll be referencing it later on in the post and you should add the rules where indicated by the comment. If you get confused by any of my instructions around adding the firewall rules, there is a complete rule set at the end of the post you can reference directly.</p><p>Finally let's make sure the firewall is enabled and running:</p><div class=highlight><div class=chroma><table class=lntable><tr><td class=lntd><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code><span class=lnt id=hl-2-1><a class=lnlinks href=#hl-2-1>1</a>

This method is very symmetric (all the firewalls and configs should effectively be the same on the two tunnel instances) but there are a few places where the remote IP and local IPs need to be referenced. Going forward I'm going to refer to the two networks as "east" and "west" but these are arbitrary labels.</p><p>You'll need to collect the public IP from the AWS console for your tunnel hosts in both the "east" and "west". For me I'm going to use "5.5.5.5" for the "west" IP and "7.7.7.7" for the "east" IP. If you see these in the configs you'll want to replace them with the appropriate values for your networks. If you expect this to last a long time or will be a business critical tunnel I highly recommend using an Elastic IP on each of these hosts.</p><p>You'll need to setup a dedicated security group for each of the tunnel hosts. To avoid bouncing back and forth between these the security groups as we progress through the guide I'm going to put all the rules we're going to need in the following table. These are inbound rules only and can be hardened a bit (but I'll get to that later), let's focus on getting this up and running first.</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center>Type</th><th style=text-align:center>Protocol</th><th style=text-align:center>Port Range</th><th style=text-align:center>Source</th><th style=text-align:center>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center>SSH</td><td style=text-align:center>TCP</td><td style=text-align:center>22</td><td style=text-align:center>0.0.0.0/0</td><td style=text-align:center>SSH Access</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>Custom Protocol</td><td style=text-align:center>ESP (50)</td><td style=text-align:center>All</td><td style=text-align:center>{other public IP}/32</td><td style=text-align:center>IPSec Encapsulated Packets</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>Custom UDP Rule</td><td style=text-align:center>UDP</td><td style=text-align:center>500</td><td style=text-align:center>{other public IP}/32</td><td style=text-align:center>IPSec Key Management</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>Custom ICMP Rule - IPv4</td><td style=text-align:center>Echo Request</td><td style=text-align:center>N/A</td><td style=text-align:center>0.0.0.0/0</td><td style=text-align:center>Connectivity Checking</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>All TCP</td><td style=text-align:center>TCP</td><td style=text-align:center>0-65535</td><td style=text-align:center>10.0.0.0/8</td><td style=text-align:center>Internal TCP Traffic</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>All UDP</td><td style=text-align:center>UDP</td><td style=text-align:center>0-65535</td><td style=text-align:center>10.0.0.0/8</td><td style=text-align:center>Internal UDP Traffic</td></tr></tbody></table><p>You'll want to replace "{other public IP}" with the public IP of the tunnel host in the opposite network. For example if this is the security group for the "west" tunnel host, you'd be allowing the traffic from "7.7.7.7".</p><p>If you're doing this in another environment you may also need "UDP/4500" from the other public IP when NAT traversal is required. AWS EC2 instances are NAT'd <a href=/blog/2019/03/aws-elastic-ip-details/>but we can work around that</a> and will include that later on.</p><p>With the security groups in place, and the local firewalls configured make sure each host can ping each other. If they can great! If not, double check all the IPs, security group rules, and iptables rules all match what I have documented here.</p><h2 id=the-ipsec-tunnel>The IPSec Tunnel</h2><p>This tunnel provides strong authentication and encryption for all the traffic that will be exchanged between the two networks. We've already installed the required packages we just need to configure the various pieces to get it running.</p><p>First let's handle the firewall. In the "/etc/sysconfig/iptables" file we standardized on earlier we need to add a couple of rules to each tunnel host for the IPSec traffic. Add these just after the note for adding filter rules and before the "REJECT" rules:</p><pre tabindex=0><code class=language-iptables data-lang=iptables>-A INPUT -p esp -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -m udp -p udp --sport 500 --dport 500 -j ACCEPT
#-A INPUT -m udp -p udp --sport 4500 --dport 4500 -j ACCEPT
</code></pre><p>This will allow tunneled packets and key exchange through the firewall. If you're not on AWS when setting this up you may need to uncomment that third rule for NAT traversal packets.</p><p>These rules are pretty unrestricted, but we have already narrowed down who will be able to connect using the security group for these machines. By leaving a more refined specification out of our definition here our iptables rules can remain symmetric on both hosts making automated management through a DevOps tool simpler.</p><p>Next up there are some specific sysctl settings that need to be adjusted for the tunneled packets to not be rejected by the kernel. The reason behind the sysctl settings is pretty well <a href=https://libreswan.org/wiki/FAQ>documented on LibreSwan's FAQ</a> if you're curious for why they're needed.</p><p>You'll want to append the following to "/etc/sysctl.conf" on both tunnel hosts:</p><pre tabindex=0><code class=language-sysctl data-lang=sysctl>net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects=0
net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects=0
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=0
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects=0
net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects=0
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=0

# Annoyingly, this seems to ignore the defaults set above. This should be
# interface that libreswan will be receiving the IPSec connections on
net.ipv4.conf.eth0.rp_filter=0
</code></pre><p>With that in place run <code>sysctl -p</code> to apply the new settings and <code>systemctl restart iptables.service</code> to update the firewall rules.</p><p>We'll quickly do a global IPSec config to make sure we're on the same page.

This provides a layer of security against other misconfigurations.</p><p>Since all of the traffic will only be routed to the tunnel endpoint if the GRE tunnel is up and will always travel over the GRE tunnel we can simplify our firewall policy around enforcement of encrypted traffic. If we guarantee all GRE traffic is encrypted over the IPSec tunnel, all traffic using the GRE tunnel will be encrypted with only a single universal firewall rule.</p><p>One final benefit with the firewall is that we get a separate interface we can use to identify the direction traffic is traveling through our tunnels without worrying about the details of IP addresses (which will be changing in unusual ways later on).</p><p>If these benefits don't justify the 24 byte per packet overhead to you, you're welcome to skip this section but you'll need to figure out the changes to the firewall rules and routing tables on your own later on.</p><p>Let's start the setup with a safety net.

If the firewalls allowed us to forward traffic right now, any traffic either tunnel host received with a destination of "172.16.0.0/12" would ping pong back and forth across the tunnel until it's TTL expired. This would end up being a nasty traffic amplification issue if we allowed it.</p><p>Handling this requires us to rewrite the packet destination received from the tunnel to the VPC's network before the kernel can make a routing decision on it and thus we use our first firewall incantation in the "nat" table. On each tunnel host add the following rule:</p><pre tabindex=0><code class=language-iptables data-lang=iptables>-A PREROUTING -i tun0 -d 172.16.0.0/12 -j NETMAP --to 10.0.0.0/12
</code></pre><p>Side note: It's not documented very well but when the "NETMAP" is used in the "PREROUTING" chain it only effects the destination network. When used in the "POSTROUTING" chain it only effects the source address (which we'll make use of later).</p><p>While we're updating our firewall we should also allow our forwarded traffic. The following two rules need to be added to the "filter" section of each tunnel host:</p><pre tabindex=0><code class=language-iptables data-lang=iptables>-A FORWARD -i eth0 -o tun0 -s 10.0.0.0/12 -d 172.16.0.0/12 -j ACCEPT
-A FORWARD -i tun0 -o eth0 -s 172.16.0.0/12 -d 10.0.0.0/12 -j ACCEPT
</code></pre><p>You may notice that I'm specifying "10.0.0.0/12" instead of "10.0.0.0/8". This is a limitation I mentioned at the beginning of this article which worked in my instance. You can't uniquely map a larger network into a smaller network. If your hosts are more scattered this is where you'll need to start duplicating rules and using smaller subnet masks for targeted groups of hosts. There will be other rules coming up shortly you'll need to update as well.</p><p>As part of this our rules won't forward traffic coming from our tunnel hosts subnet of "10.255.254.0/30" as it is way outside of "10.0.0.0/12". Simply allowing this subnet won't allow us to receive the responses to any traffic leaving our tunnel hosts for the opposite network as the source address will appear local to the VPC. We can reserve two more addresses within the range of "172.16.0.0/12" to work as our tunnel endpoints. This isn't strictly necessary if you really need the two addresses but they make diagnostics significantly simpler.</p><p>We can map our two addresses appropriately using the fixed 1:1 NAT mapping in the kernel by adding the following rules in the "nat" section of each tunnel hosts firewall:</p><pre tabindex=0><code class=language-iptables data-lang=iptables>-A PREROUTING -i tun0 -d 172.31.254.1 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.255.254.1
-A PREROUTING -i tun0 -d 172.31.254.2 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.255.254.2

-A POSTROUTING -o tun0 -d 10.255.254.1 -j SNAT --to-source 172.31.254.1
-A POSTROUTING -o tun0 -d 10.255.254.2 -j SNAT --to-source 172.31.254.2
</code></pre><p>Only half of these rules apply to each tunnel host, but it doesn't hurt having both sets on both hosts and it keeps us symmetrical. You should be able to ping each of the tunnel hosts equivalent "172.31.254.0/30" address at this point (if you restart the firewall).</p><p>Right now if a client host added a route pointing at either of the tunnel host for the mapped network it would make it out the opposite tunnel host's "eth0" interface but it would still have a "10.0.0.0/12" source address and the packet would never return to the tunnel host, much less the host on the other network.</p><p>This is a bit tricky as we only want to rewrite the source address (requiring a "POSTROUTING" rule) but only want it to effect mapped traffic addresses coming in from a normal VPC network, and "POSTROUTING" can't match on source interface. We want to handle this rewriting before any other changes have occurred which requires us to do the source address rewriting happen on the source tunnel host.</p><p>To handle this we can use a combination of traffic markers and our handy "NETMAP" target. On both of the tunnel hosts add the following two rules to the "nat" section:</p><pre tabindex=0><code class=language-iptables data-lang=iptables>-A PREROUTING -i tun0 -d 172.16.0.0/12 -s 10.0.0.0/12 -j MARK --set-mark 0x01
-A POSTROUTING -o tun0 -m mark --mark 0x01 -s 10.0.0.0/12 -j NETMAP --to 172.16.0.0/12

</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></div><p>That's the last of the changes we need to make to the tunnel hosts, now the other hosts need to learn how to send their traffic to the other side...</p><h2 id=vpc-routing>VPC Routing</h2><p>Hosts inside a VPC will directly send traffic to any other host within it's defined network. For networks beyond their VPC subnet (such as our "172.16.0.0/12") network will send their traffic to their default gateway which is the VPC router. These routers are configurable within the AWS web console by going to the "VPC" section, finding the relevant VPC you're using and clicking on the link to your "Main Route Table".</p><p>Under the "Routes" sub-tab on the selected Route Table, click on the "Edit routes" button. Add "172.16.0.0/12" as a destination to the routes. Click on the "Target" drop down, choose "Instance" and find your VPC tunnel host in the list. Click "Save Routes" and allow a minute or two for the route to update.</p><p>There is a sneaky potential issue here. If you've gone and done some deep customization to your VPC, you may have created and specified additional route tables for specific subnets. You'll want to evaluate each of the potential route tables and add the same route to each one.</p><p>There is one final thing generally stopping our traffic from flowing freely. By default every single EC2 instance drops any traffic that reaches an EC2 instance with a source or destination address that doesn't match the IP that has been assigned to that instance. This is generally a very useful protection, but we'll be shooting out packets with source addresses in the "172.16.0.0/12" range so need to disable this protection on each of tunnel hosts.</p><p>Find your tunnel host in the list of your EC2 instances. Right click on the instance, go to the "Networking" sub-menu, and choose "Change Source/Dest. Check". It will pop up a confirmation, confirm it by clicking on "Yes, Disable".</p><p>Now the only thing preventing hosts in each VPC from talking to each other is their respective inbound security groups but the traffic should flow freely. We're effectively done and everything should be happy.</p><p>It may not be immediately obvious but you will have to do some math to convert the IP addresses of the remote subnet into the mapping network. Specifically you'll need to replace the first octet ("10") with the mapping network's first octet ("172"), then add "16" to the second octet. If the resulting second octet is greater than "31" it won't be able to traverse the network. The remaining two octets are left unchanged.</p><p>Some examples of what this translation looks like:</p><ul><li>"10.0.0.2" becomes "172.16.0.2"</li><li>"10.4.1.80" becomes "172.20.1.80"</li><li>"10.30.56.100" becomes "172.46.56.100" and is unroutable</li></ul><p>No matter which side of the tunnel you're on the other side's addresses will always be mapped this way.</p><h2 id=hardening>Hardening</h2><p>We have some fairly wide open firewall rules for passing traffic on the tunneling hosts themselves and in the security groups on them. These can certainly be tightened further and I'll even cover some situations in a bit about when you might want to do that. As it stands right now the internal private IP addresses of the tunnel host's and clients haven't matter beyond whether or not they were in the routable range.</p><p>If you use ephemeral containers or autoscaling IP addresses are going to change frequently. To harden the rules on the tunnel hosts themselves would need to be updated whenever these addresses change which removes a lot of benefits. Since we're already using a dedicated security group for our tunnel hosts, we can instead have other security groups reference it directly.</p><p>To allow traffic from the opposite VPC side, allow the relevant port's traffic from the tunnel host's security group and bam problem solved. This is still somewhat course granularity of firewalling as you are effectively granting the entire other VPC access to that service port. In a lot of cases that will be enough and additional network controls such as inter-service authentication will be sufficient to mitigating additional issues.</p><p>If you do need finer granularity you can start by limiting traffic on the VPC tunnel's inbound security group from the opposite side. If that is not fine grained enough you can eventually resort to firewall rules in the "FORWARD" chain itself.</p><p>There is one additional benefit of putting the rules in the forward chain if your addresses are sufficiently static to deploy rules through it. With security groups alone, the traffic will traverse the tunnel before being dropped by the opposing side's security group. Likely your service will retry the connection. These little bits of traffic do add up and will take time.</p><p>If you instead firewall with reject packets as they enter the tunnel, a service will get immediate feedback the traffic won't flow. No additional bandwidth is wasted and the latency will be very small. You can also log these packets with a "LOG" target before rejecting them so you can audit and diagnose traffic that doesn't make it through the tunnel.</p><p>For those reasons I do prefer to firewall at the tunnel hosts themselves for sufficiently static services.</p><h2 id=troubleshooting>Troubleshooting</h2><p>I've tried to include basic diagnostics for each piece that we've built up but if you're still having issues getting traffic flowing here is a checklist to look over that might help diagnose the source of the issue:</p><ul><li>Restart the tunnel host's network</li><li>Verify the tunnel host's firewalls match the final reference firewall below</li><li>Restart the tunnel host's firewalls</li><li>Make sure each tunnel host can ping the other one</li><li>Ensure "libreswan" service is up and running ("/var/log/secure" will have any errors it encounters if the tunnel isn't coming up</li><li>Verify the GRE tunnel is up by pinging the other end's tunnel IP</li><li>Check the routing table on both tunnel hosts</li><li>Ensure source and destination hosts are within the "10.0.0.0/12" range</li><li>Make sure the source / destination checking is disabled on the tunnel host's EC2 instances</li><li>Check to make sure the VPC routing tables include "172.16.0.0/12" pointing at the tunnel hosts in both networks.</li><li>Check the relevant security groups to make sure all other traffic is allowed to/from the tunnel hosts in each security group</li></ul><p>If all else fails sniff the traffic on the interfaces you expect for the packets in each place to make sure they're going where you expect. Usually this makes it pretty clear to me whether packets are even getting to the tunnel hosts and which interface they either stop or aren't being manipulated at.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>This post was quite a wild ride for me to write up and is probably my longest post to date.
