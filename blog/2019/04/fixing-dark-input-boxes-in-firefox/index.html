                <p>I recently began trying out <a href="https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon">Cinnamon</a> as my desktop environment and I&rsquo;ve
been thoroughly enjoying it. The only issue I was having was occasionally a
page&rsquo;s form input fields would have a dark background while still having dark
text making it impossible to read, and very difficult to write.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t happening everywhere, and I couldn&rsquo;t track down what about a website
would cause the issue. Most prominently for me was when this showed up in AWS&rsquo;s
interface.</p>
<p><img src="/images/dark_firefox_inputs.png" alt="Example of Dark Input in AWS Security Groups"></p>
<p>Searching around apparently this was an issue with dark GTK themes and has been
a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=70315">known issue for about 18 years</a> and was re-reported again <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1283086">about 3 years
ago</a>. There have been a really bad workaround that people have suggested
including <a href="https://github.com/DmitriK/darkContrast#text-contrast-for-dark-themes">extensions</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19911090/firefox-how-to-see-text-in-input-fields-with-black-background-set-in-preference">custom user CSS</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/@lsm/fix-firefox-dark-text-input-on-ubuntu-18-when-using-gnome-dark-themes-98f253f8ed7f">using desktop shortcuts
with environment variables</a>.</p>
<p>None of these work well, will be inconsistent based on how you open Firefox, or
might cause other issues with different websites. Generally I&rsquo;m not a fan of
using random extensions for security, stability, and performance reasons.
Ultimately Mozilla hasn&rsquo;t fixed this issue, but there is a workable override at
this point.</p>
<p>To solve the issue we do need to override the GTK theme with a light one.
Generally people recommend <code>Adwaita</code> for the light theme that fixes it and it
seems to work well for me. You can check and make sure that the theme is
available by checking the <code>/usr/share/themes</code> directory on your system.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;ve confirmed the presence of the theme, open up Firefox and go to the
URL <code>about:config</code>. This override value doesn&rsquo;t exist by default so you&rsquo;ll need
to right click anywhere in that page and go to <code>New -&gt; String</code> in that context
menu. For the preference name enter <code>widget.content.gtk-theme-override</code> and for
the value enter <code>Adwaita</code>. After refreshing the effected pages the background
color issue should be resolved.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re making use of a <code>user.js</code> to enforce configuration options you can
add the following line to it address the issue:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#c9d1d9;background-color:#0d1117;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>user_pref(&#34;widget.content.gtk-theme-override&#34;, &#34;Adwaita&#34;);
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>A little side note in case someone comes looking for other options. There was
another <code>about:config</code> option that some Stack Overflow answers recommended
changing, <code>widget.content.allow-gtk-dark-theme</code>. The default is <code>false</code> and
they&rsquo;re recommending changing it to&hellip; <code>false</code>. It&rsquo;s not the answer to this
problem.</p>
<p>Hope this helps someone else out. Cheers!</p>
