  <h1><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stelfox.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2019&#x2F;aws-elastic-ip-details&#x2F;">AWS Elastic IP Details</a></h1>

  <div class="post-content"><p>Sometimes it becomes important to understand how your cloud provider implements
certain networking details. While working through an issue in AWS I needed to
understand how they handle public IP addressing. While this issue for me was
specific to an Elastic IP all of their public addresses are handled this way
and may bite you even without them. The problems specifically crop up when a
hosted piece of software does NAT traversal detection and changes it's behavior
based on the result.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>Amazon attaches public IP address to EC2 instances (and likely other of their
hosted services) through 1:1 NAT mapping of external to internal addresses. All
traffic will reach your instance without issue, but your system's native
networking stack will (by default) not become aware of what that public IP is.</p>
<p>In most cases this isn't an issue, the traffic ends up at your instance and is
properly changed to the internal address so your system responds without any
additional configuration work.</p>
<p>The first issue is tunneled traffic. I <a href="https://stelfox.net/blog/2019/fighting-ipsec-on-aws/">experienced this</a> in my last post
with IPSec. The tunneled traffic is not modified by going through a 1:1 NAT and
your host will not recognize the external address inside the tunnel, which in
most cases will result in silently dropped packets (the &quot;oh this isn't for me&quot;
syndrome).</p>
<p>There are ways to get your system to respond to tunneled packets with other IP
addresses such as treating it like a high-availability shared virtual server IP
address but I have yet to find a clean way to deal with responding to the
address. IPSec had a way to deal with this built in directly and I'd refer you
back to <a href="https://stelfox.net/blog/2019/fighting-ipsec-on-aws/">my other post</a> to read about that.</p>
<p>Usually sniffing the tunneled traffic is enough to diagnose these issues.
What is a bit more pernicious, is when a server changes its behavior when it
detects a NAT in place. This requires deeper understanding of the protocol in
use and in some cases the specific server implementation. Once again this post
is ultimately about IPSec (and specifically libreswan).</p>
<p>While you don't have to make any changes to get IPSec working with AWS public
IPs it will detect the NAT and start encapsulating the traffic. The
encapsulation will require an additional port being opened on your security
group firewall but more importantly, it will add variable latency and
additional processing overhead to each packet. Not everything is sensitive to
this but you'll be needlessly adding overhead to your network traffic is you
don't address it. In my case (AWS VPC to AWS VPC) there aren't any meaningful
NATs in place that require this encapsulation to function appropriately.</p>
<p>If you encounter this and are using libreswan on AWS you only need to add the
following two lines to your tunnel's config disable this behavior:</p>
<pre><code>encapsulation=no
nat-keepalive=no
</code></pre>
<p>I hope this helps someone else diagnose weird behavior when working with public
IP addresses on AWS.</p>
