protocol level flaw in WPA & WPA2. The advisory itself was:</p><blockquote><p>US-CERT has become aware of several key management vulnerabilities in the
4-way handshake of the Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) security protocol.
The impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities includes decryption, packet
replay, TCP connection hijacking, HTTP content injection, and others. Note
that as protocol-level issues, most or all correct implementations of the
standard will be affected. The CERT/CC and the reporting researcher KU
Leuven, will be publicly disclosing these vulnerabilities on 16 October 2017.</p></blockquote><p>Details of the vulnerability have been <a href=https://www.krackattacks.com/>released today</a>, and paint a pretty
horrifying picture. Ultimately this is an issue with a mechanism for dealing
with lost packets during the initial 4-way key negotiation and the client&rsquo;s
behavior when they receive one of these packets after they&rsquo;re session is
already established.</p><p>Almost all WiFi devices out there are vulnerable to this attack and patches
should be applied as soon as they are available. Some very quick and important
notes I&rsquo;d like to make available for people:</p><ul><li>This is an active against clients</li><li>WPA & WPA2 both personal and enterprise are effected</li><li>The WiFi association key (your network&rsquo;s passphrase) is safe, this attack
breaks a per-client session key.</li><li>Assume all your traffic is being sent in plain text and can be manipulated by
an attacker until you have patched.</li></ul><p>If you have a VPN available to your client devices, having it active will
protect your traffic from this attack.</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg>
