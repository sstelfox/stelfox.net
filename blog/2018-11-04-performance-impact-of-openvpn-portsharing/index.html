traffic. This was done as a compromise with administrators who didn&rsquo;t want to
change their egress filtering, but wanted to allow me to continue doing my
normal work.</p><p>I already run several webservers, including this one, and didn&rsquo;t want to give
up exclusive access to the precious TCP port 443. The recommended way to deal
with this is to make use of the <code>port-share</code> option built into OpenVPN. This
left me with two choices, run this on an existing server sharing the port with
existing websites, or setup a dedicated server just for this instance of
OpenVPN.</p><p>I couldn&rsquo;t find any other posts that took a look at how this port sharing
effects the performance of the HTTPS server so I felt like doing a quick
analysis for other curious parties.</p><p>I setup a fresh Nginx server with Let&rsquo;s Encrypt certificates that mimics my
production setup and used <code>ab</code> to bench the service for 30 seconds. The mean
measured rate was 288.70 +/- 14.39 requests per second. Mean request
fullfillment took 3.47 +/- 0.17 ms.</p><p>After enabling <code>port-share</code> on OpenVPN I reran the exact same test. The result
was 139.76 +/- 67.68 requests per second. Mean measured request fullfillment
7.44 +/- 4.16 ms.</p><p>That is a 51% peak request handling reduction, each request has an additional
4-8ms of latency, and an almost 40x increase of jitter. That is a massive
relative impact but the vast majority of the websites I run need won&rsquo;t be
terribly impacted by that additional latency.</p><p>I ultimately ended up setting up a seperate server for OpenVPN as I didn&rsquo;t want
to mess with known working systems.</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg>
