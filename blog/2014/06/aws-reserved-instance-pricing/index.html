requested to do a cost estimate. Looking into it, it quickly became clear that
reserved instances could potentially save quite a bit of cash but there was a
catch (isn&rsquo;t there always?).</p><p>There is an upfront cost for reserving the instance and in exchange you get a
reduced hourly rate. After running the numbers one thing wasn&rsquo;t clear too me,
is the upfront cost credit towards running machines or a fee you never see
again?</p><p>I immediately assumed the latter based on the numbers for one simple reason. If
you use the &lsquo;Light Reserved Instance&rsquo; with a 1 year reservation, have your
machine running 24/7 the whole year it will cost your <em>more</em> than running the
same instance as &lsquo;on demand&rsquo;. This was true for their m1.small, m3.medium, and
m3.large which was the only ones I ran the numbers for.</p><p>I searched the internet and wasn&rsquo;t able to find a solid answer to the question
until I asked Amazon&rsquo;s customer service directly.</p><p>Ultimately there probably is a price point where 1 year light reserved
instances make sense, and if you&rsquo;re looking too run 24/7 for the whole year
you&rsquo;ll want to do a heavy anyway for the most savings but it still surprised
me.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll probably do a project later using <a href=http://d3js.org/>d3.js</a> to get some direct hours run
vs total cost for various instances. It&rsquo;ll probably be a fun project.</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg>
