a large number of backgrounds. I wanted to have rolling backgrounds that almost
never repeated.</p><p>I let my crawler go and stopped it after a 24 hour period. I ran <code>ls</code> on the
directory the images were being saved in to see the results and my ssh session
locked up&mldr; Or so I thought. I hit Ctrl-C and nothing happened&mldr; So I closed
my window and opened a new one.</p><p>Maybe there was a file name that hit some weird glitch in <code>ls</code> causing it too
lock up. Not a big deal I can start from scratch. I switched to the directory
and ran an <code>rm -f *</code> and was greeted with this:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>/bin/rm: Argument list too long.
</code></pre><p>Wait what? All I get was this irritating and slightly elusive error message. So
the * was being expanded, and making the list too long? To be sure I started
hunting in the man pages. <code>man rm</code> recommended me to <code>info coreutils 'rm invocation'</code>. I read through and couldn&rsquo;t find any limitations or warnings that
might relate to the problem. The only thing I could find in there was a line
that said:</p><blockquote><p>GNU &lsquo;rm&rsquo;, like every program that uses the &lsquo;getopt&rsquo; function to parse its
arguments&mldr;</p></blockquote><p>Moving on&mldr; getopt is parsing it&rsquo;s options&mldr; man and info pages on getopt
don&rsquo;t really reveal anything&mldr;</p><p>After some creative Googling I found the answer: getopt&rsquo;s argument limit is
1024. How many files did I have? I wanted to give ls one more try&mldr; I
typed it in and sure enough console froze&mldr; Or did it? I walked away and
did other things. When I came back I had a list of files longer than my
console buffer. I was smarter the second time around: <code>ls | wc -l</code>. After
about five minutes it came back again with just the number.</p><blockquote><p>177654</p></blockquote><p>I needed to clean up that directory and rm wasn&rsquo;t going to help me. `find . |
xargs rm -f1 and&mldr;. Victory! The directory is clean and happy again. Now I&rsquo;ll
just have to figure out how to cut down the number of files, or at the very
least organize them into more managable chunks&mldr;</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg>
