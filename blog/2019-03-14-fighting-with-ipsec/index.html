setup and going&mldr; Most of the time. While setting up an IPSec tunnel to an AWS
host I came across a new and unique experience that didn&rsquo;t seem to have an
easily searchable solution.</p><p>I had two CentOS 7 EC2 instances, each set up with their own Elastic IP in a
default VPC. I installed and configured libreswan with the following config:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>conn setup
  protostack=netkey

conn site-tunnel
  auto=start
  pfs=yes

  leftid=@left_tunnel_server_name
  rightid=@right_tunnel_server_name
  left=%defaultroute
  right=&lt;remote-ip&gt;

  authby=rsasig
  leftrsasigkey=&lt;left-key&gt;
  rightrsasigkey=&lt;right-key&gt;
</code></pre><p>The IPSec link came up without issue but pings were timing out without a
response. When sniffing the incoming packets, I was appropriately seeing the
ICMP echo requests coming in encapsulated in the tunnel and being re-injected.
There was never a response being generated.</p><p>The traffic capture was also pretty clear as to why. The encapsulated packet
had the elastic IP as the destination which the EC2 instance doesn&rsquo;t
<em>ACTUALLY</em> have and wasn&rsquo;t aware&mldr; So it didn&rsquo;t attempt to respond.</p><p>I went down a bit of a rabbit hole attempting to get the instance to recognize
that address with limited success. Adding the IP to an additional loopback
interface&mldr; IPTables DNAT rules&mldr; Some of them worked but they were dirty
hacks that would have been left until something blew up&mldr;</p><p>The solution was simple and even improved the overall performance of the
link. By default libreswan operates in <code>tunnel</code> mode which sends along the
destination information as well (and can be used for routing network across).
For the use I almost always use these links for, <code>transport</code> is more
appropriate and has less protocol overhead.</p><p>By adding the following line to the connection configuration on both sides the
problem vanished:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>  type=transport
</code></pre><p>With any luck the next person that comes across this issue will find this post
and their life will be a tad bit easier.</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg>
