                <p>While setting up a gentoo install with a full disk encryption, I continuously
got to a point where the passphrase would show up on boot but I was unable to
enter the passphrase. The behavior of the keyboard was also odd, it would
toggle it&rsquo;s numlock light every couple of button presses.</p>
<p>Once again this was an issue that was hard to search for, and most other people
asking it seemed to only get snarky non-answers which seem so prevalent in
forums.</p>
<p>Ultimately the issue was with me not having XHCI support compiled into my
kernel and having my keyboard plugged into a USB 3.0 or 3.1 port. After
enabling and recompiling my kernel the issue immediately cleared up.</p>
