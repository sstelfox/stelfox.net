compilation test bed for new software since I can control the dependency
versions very tightly. I have a set of scripts I&rsquo;ve been using for quite some
time that handle setting up a hardened, fairly minimal install.</p><p>I recently encountered a weird issue with them that resulted in an esoteric
error that prevented my host from fully booting and leaving the root filesystem
read-only. There also didn&rsquo;t seem to be much reliable information on the
problem so I&rsquo;m documenting it here in hopes it may help someone else.</p><p>In addition to the read-only filesystem, none of the system services would
start up leaving me with the kernel&rsquo;s default hostname of <code>(none)</code>. This
includes networking so I had to diagnose this directly via the console. I was
able to login as a user but unable to use <code>sudo</code> to switch to a new user
(though I could still use it to execute commands with elevated privileges).</p><p>I was able to verify all the OpenRC services had not started with by executing:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>sudo rc-status
</code></pre><p>I attempted to start the SSH daemon (though any networked service should behave
the same) using the following command:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>sudo service sshd start
</code></pre><p>This was the first time any error had directly presented itself to my screen
(and since my filesystems were read-only, and my logger was stopped I had no on
disk logs to go off from). The error that was repeated over my screen was the
following:</p><pre tabindex=0><code> * Checking local filesystems  .../sbin/fsck.xfs: XFS file system.
fsck.fat 4.0 (2016-05-06)
open: No such file or directory

 * Filesystems couldn&#39;t be fixed
                                         [ !! ]
 * ERROR: fsck failed to start
 * ERROR: cannot start root as fsck would not start
</code></pre><p>This was quite confusing and more than a little concerning as XFS doesn&rsquo;t use
<code>fsck</code>, instead it uses <code>xfs_repair</code>. There was also the &ldquo;No such file or
directory&rdquo; error which also didn&rsquo;t seem to make sense.</p><p>Ultimately, after reviewing the <code>fsck</code> init script I found the culprit. There
was a bad line in my <code>/etc/fstab</code> file pointing at a device that didn&rsquo;t exist.
I was able to remount my root filesystem read-write and edit my fstab to fix
the device name in my fstab file:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>sudo mount -o remount,rw /
sudoedit /etc/fstab
</code></pre><p>Tracing things back, this was ultimately caused by the Gentoo installation
medium detecting it&rsquo;s only disk as <code>/dev/sda</code> while the kernel I use exposed it
as <code>/dev/vda</code>. Since I was already using a GPT filesystem I was able to adjust
my scripts so they reference this particular partition by UUID instead of
directly by device name.</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg>
