They are effectively equivalent in their functionality. The simpler form is the following format:</p><pre tabindex=0><code class=language-audit-conf data-lang=audit-conf>-w /etc/shadow -p wa
-w /boot -p wa
-w /etc/dont_readme -p r</code></pre><p>These three rules are all behaving slightly differently. The first will audit any writes or attribute changes to the shadow file. The second, being a directory, will be recursively watched for writes and attribute changes (including the directory itself). The last line will create an audit record whenever the file is read.</p><p>The second form is more consistent with the syscall rule types but more verbose. Examples are given in the man page for converting between the two forms. Before I show you an example of those rules, this is the part of the man page that ultimately confused me:</p><blockquote><p>If you place a watch on a file, its the same as using the -F path option on a syscall rule.</p></blockquote><p>Simple enough, this is what the first line of the first example would look like in this style:</p><pre tabindex=0><code class=language-audit-conf data-lang=audit-conf>-a always,exit -F path=/etc/shadow -F perm=wa</code></pre><p>Before changing my rules over to this form I checked a couple to ensure they were behaving correctly then migrated the rest. After applying the new rules I found quite a few audit records I&rsquo;d expect missing. If I had kept reading (the next line from the last man page) I would have found this:</p><blockquote><p>If you place a watch on a directory, its the same as using the -F dir option on a syscall rule.</p></blockquote><p>So the correct way to represent the second line in the first example would be like this:</p><pre tabindex=0><code class=language-audit-conf data-lang=audit-conf>-a always,exit -F dir=/boot -F perm=wa</code></pre><p>The long and short of it, is that the watch flag (-w) has different behaviors depending on what it is pointing at. Having only read the first sentence, I assumed the &ldquo;path=&rdquo; argument would behave the same as a watch. Attempts to Google whether or not &ldquo;path=&rdquo; was recursive didn&rsquo;t turn up anything. Now that I&rsquo;ve read the man page while writing up this point it is very clearly stated that it is not.</p><p>If anyone else comes across this, &ldquo;path=&rdquo; is not recursive, &ldquo;dir=&rdquo; is. Be careful when translating your rules.</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg>
