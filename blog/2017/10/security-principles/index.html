You can find it in the <a href=http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-123.pdf>NIST Guide to General Server Security</a> (published in 2008).</p><p>I've replicated section 2.4 from the linked document (I have removed the footnotes, but it is otherwise unchanged) in its entirety here for safe keeping and to hopefully help expose this to more people.</p><p>When addressing server security issues, it is an excellent idea to keep in mind the following general information security principles</p><ul><li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Security mechanisms (and information systems in general) should be as simple as possible. Complexity is at the root of many security issues.</li><li><strong>Fail-Safe:</strong> If a failure occurs, the system should fail in a secure manner, i.e., security controls and settings remain in effect and are enforced. It is usually better to lose functionality rather than security.</li><li><strong>Complete Mediation:</strong> Rather than providing direct access to information, mediators that enforce access policy should be employed. Common examples of mediators include file system permissions, proxies, firewalls, and mail gateways.</li><li><strong>Open Design:</strong> System security should not depend on the secrecy of the implementation or its components.</li><li><strong>Separation of Privilege:</strong> Functions, to the degree possible, should be separate and provide as much granularity as possible. The concept can apply to both systems and operators and users. In the case of systems, functions such as read, edit, write, and execute should be separate. In the case of system operators and users, roles should be as separate as possible. For example, if resources allow, the role of system administrator should be separate from that of the database administrator.</li><li><strong>Least Privilege:</strong> This principle dictates that each task, process, or user is granted the minimum rights required to perform its job. By applying this principle consistently, if a task, process, or user is compromised, the scope of damage is constrained to the limited resources available to the compromised entity.</li><li><strong>Psychological Acceptability:</strong> Users should understand the necessity of security. This can be provided through training and education. In addition, the security mechanisms in place should present users with sensible options that give them the usability they require on a daily basis. If users find the security mechanisms too cumbersome, they may devise ways to work around or compromise them. The objective is not to weaken security so it is understandable and acceptable, but to train and educate users and to design security mechanisms and policies that are usable and effective.</li><li><strong>Least Common Mechanism:</strong> When providing a feature for the system, it is best to have a single process or service gain some function without granting that same function to other parts of the system. The ability for the Web server process to access a back-end database, for instance, should not also enable other applications on the system to access the back-end database.</li><li><strong>Defense-in-Depth:</strong> Organizations should understand that a single security mechanism is generally insufficient. Security mechanisms (defenses) need to be layered so that compromise of a single security mechanism is insufficient to compromise a host or network. No "silver bullet" exists for information system security.</li><li><strong>Work Factor:</strong> Organizations should understand what it would take to break the system or network’s security features. The amount of work necessary for an attacker to break the system or network should exceed the value that the attacker would gain from a successful compromise.</li><li><strong>Compromise Recording:</strong> Records and logs should be maintained so that if a compromise does occur, evidence of the attack is available to the organization. This information can assist in securing the network and host after the compromise and aid in identifying the methods and exploits used by the attacker. This information can be used to better secure the host or network in the future. In addition, these records and logs can assist organizations in identifying and prosecuting attackers.</li></ul></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg>
