            <div class="post-content">
                <p>An advisory from US CERT has been circulating for the last week about a
protocol level flaw in WPA &amp; WPA2. The advisory itself was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>US-CERT has become aware of several key management vulnerabilities in the
4-way handshake of the Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) security protocol.
The impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities includes decryption, packet
replay, TCP connection hijacking, HTTP content injection, and others. Note
that as protocol-level issues, most or all correct implementations of the
standard will be affected. The CERT/CC and the reporting researcher KU
Leuven, will be publicly disclosing these vulnerabilities on 16 October 2017.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Details of the vulnerability have been <a href="https://www.krackattacks.com/">released today</a>, and paint a pretty
horrifying picture. Ultimately this is an issue with a mechanism for dealing
with lost packets during the initial 4-way key negotiation and the client&rsquo;s
behavior when they receive one of these packets after they&rsquo;re session is
already established.</p>
<p>Almost all WiFi devices out there are vulnerable to this attack and patches
should be applied as soon as they are available. Some very quick and important
notes I&rsquo;d like to make available for people:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is an active against clients</li>
<li>WPA &amp; WPA2 both personal and enterprise are effected</li>
<li>The WiFi association key (your network&rsquo;s passphrase) is safe, this attack
breaks a per-client session key.</li>
<li>Assume all your traffic is being sent in plain text and can be manipulated by
an attacker until you have patched.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a VPN available to your client devices, having it active will
protect your traffic from this attack.</p>
