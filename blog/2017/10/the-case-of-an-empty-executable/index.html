It was
a curious thing already as it was hosted in a user&rsquo;s home directory off a
web server with the standard &lsquo;~&rsquo; showing up in the URL. The important
part that caught my eye was this:</p><blockquote><p>The &ldquo;true&rdquo; program does nothing; it merely exits with a zero exit status.
This can be done with an empty file that&rsquo;s marked executable, and that&rsquo;s what
it was in the earliest unix system libraries.</p></blockquote><p>Being a curious sort, and presented with an old mystery, I had to try out this
little tidbit of information:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh><span style=display:flex><span>$ echo -n &gt; test
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>$ chmod +x test
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>$ ./test
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>$ echo $?
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#ae81ff>0</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Sure enough, an empty file can be successfully run. It obviously doesn&rsquo;t have a
known binary header, so it won&rsquo;t be interpretted as a valid executable on it&rsquo;s
own. Even scripts rely on the shebang header (<code>#!</code>) to be considered valid by
the kernel, so something else has to be executing this. We can confirm the
kernel isn&rsquo;t recognizing this by abusing <code>strace</code> into calling an explicit
execve on the file:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>$ strace ./test
execve(&#34;./test&#34;, [&#34;./test&#34;], 0x7ffe74e0a720 /* 70 vars */) = -1 ENOEXEC (Exec format error)
fstat(2, {st_mode=S_IFCHR|0620, st_rdev=makedev(136, 3), ...}) = 0
write(2, &#34;strace: exec: Exec format error\n&#34;, 32strace: exec: Exec format error
) = 32
getpid()                                = 24047
exit_group(1)                           = ?
+++ exited with 1 +++
</code></pre><p>This is exactly what I was expecting and the <a href=https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/c2315c187fa0d3ab363fdebe22718170b40473e3/fs/binfmt_script.c#L24>Kernel source</a> reflects
exactly what I&rsquo;d expect. I&rsquo;ll leave it up to you test the results on an empty
but otherwise valid shell script. With the kernel cleared of any odd behavior I
was left with only one suspect. A little shell by the name of bash.</p><p>Bash is a coy devil with several different mechanisms built-in to execute a
program. Likely one of these culprits are being used behind the scenes when we
run a program. A quick trip the <a href=https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.txt>man page</a> and a late night cup of coffee
narrowed down my search to the following functions:</p><ul><li>command</li><li>eval</li><li>exec</li></ul><p>I decided it was time to talk to each of them one by one and see what was up.
Putting them under the bright light I was surprised that they all were telling
the same story:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>$ command ./test
$ echo $?
0
$ eval ./test
$ echo $?
0
$ exec ./test
-bash: /home/playground/test: Success
</code></pre><p>How sinister! Someone had gotten to them first, I have to go higher into their
organization. This calls for&mldr; The Source. I quickly traverse into the builtin
directory and identify the commonality <code>parse_and_execute</code>. This is where it
gets a little fuzzy as bash is a rather complicated code base and I didn&rsquo;t want
to spend to much time on this in the middle of the night.</p><p>After parsing the file, it does seem to treat it as a script (as expected).
There are two possibilities here and I didn&rsquo;t trace down which was true. Either
<code>parse_and_execute</code> is simply returning with a success or it is sending the
contents to <code>execute_command_internal</code>, which in turn defaults to a
successfully return value.</p><p>The motive remains unclear, but no harm seems to be getting done so I&rsquo;m going
to call this one case closed. It&rsquo;d be interesting to see how other shells
behave with empty files.</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg>
