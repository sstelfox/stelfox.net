            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I recently came across a <a href="http://trillian.mit.edu/~jc/humor/ATT_Copyright_true.html">short article</a> written about a decade ago. It was
a curious thing already as it was hosted in a user&rsquo;s home directory off a
web server with the standard &lsquo;~<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; showing up in the URL. The important
part that caught my eye was this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;true&rdquo; program does nothing; it merely exits with a zero exit status.
This can be done with an empty file that&rsquo;s marked executable, and that&rsquo;s what
it was in the earliest unix system libraries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being a curious sort, and presented with an old mystery, I had to try out this
little tidbit of information:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#c9d1d9;background-color:#0d1117;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ echo -n &gt; test
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ chmod +x test
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ ./test
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ echo <span style="color:#79c0ff">$?</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a5d6ff">0</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Sure enough, an empty file can be successfully run. It obviously doesn&rsquo;t have a
known binary header, so it won&rsquo;t be interpretted as a valid executable on it&rsquo;s
own. Even scripts rely on the shebang header (<code>#!</code>) to be considered valid by
the kernel, so something else has to be executing this. We can confirm the
kernel isn&rsquo;t recognizing this by abusing <code>strace</code> into calling an explicit
execve on the file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#c9d1d9;background-color:#0d1117;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ strace ./test
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>execve(&#34;./test&#34;, [&#34;./test&#34;], 0x7ffe74e0a720 /* 70 vars */) = -1 ENOEXEC (Exec format error)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>fstat(2, {st_mode=S_IFCHR|0620, st_rdev=makedev(136, 3), ...}) = 0
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>write(2, &#34;strace: exec: Exec format error\n&#34;, 32strace: exec: Exec format error
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>) = 32
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>getpid()                                = 24047
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>exit_group(1)                           = ?
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>+++ exited with 1 +++
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is exactly what I was expecting and the <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/c2315c187fa0d3ab363fdebe22718170b40473e3/fs/binfmt_script.c#L24">Kernel source</a> reflects
exactly what I&rsquo;d expect. I&rsquo;ll leave it up to you test the results on an empty
but otherwise valid shell script. With the kernel cleared of any odd behavior I
was left with only one suspect. A little shell by the name of bash.</p>
<p>Bash is a coy devil with several different mechanisms built-in to execute a
program. Likely one of these culprits are being used behind the scenes when we
run a program. A quick trip the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.txt">man page</a> and a late night cup of coffee
narrowed down my search to the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>command</li>
<li>eval</li>
<li>exec</li>
</ul>
<p>I decided it was time to talk to each of them one by one and see what was up.
Putting them under the bright light I was surprised that they all were telling
the same story:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#c9d1d9;background-color:#0d1117;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ command ./test
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ echo $?
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>0
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ eval ./test
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ echo $?
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>0
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ exec ./test
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>-bash: /home/playground/test: Success
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>How sinister! Someone had gotten to them first, I have to go higher into their
organization. This calls for&hellip; The Source. I quickly traverse into the builtin
directory and identify the commonality <code>parse_and_execute</code>. This is where it
gets a little fuzzy as bash is a rather complicated code base and I didn&rsquo;t want
to spend to much time on this in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>After parsing the file, it does seem to treat it as a script (as expected).
There are two possibilities here and I didn&rsquo;t trace down which was true. Either
<code>parse_and_execute</code> is simply returning with a success or it is sending the
contents to <code>execute_command_internal</code>, which in turn defaults to a
successfully return value.</p>
<p>The motive remains unclear, but no harm seems to be getting done so I&rsquo;m going
to call this one case closed. It&rsquo;d be interesting to see how other shells
behave with empty files.</p>
