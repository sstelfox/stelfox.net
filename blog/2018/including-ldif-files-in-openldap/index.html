  <div class="post-content"><p>While setting up and OpenLDAP server I found my distribution shipped with a
couple of schema files, but no equivalent LDIF files. I found ways to convert
the file using <code>slapcat</code> and <code>slaptest</code> and the files were valid on their own.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>I was specifically trying to bootstrap an OpenLDAP server, with it's schema,
from scratch for a CI/CD system to test against. To accomplish this I was
making use of the <code>include</code> directive in a configuration LDIF file and saw some
very odd behavior.</p>
<p>When I included the LDIF schema files that shipped with the software, I could
include multiple of them back to back like so:</p>
<pre><code>include: file:///etc/openldap/schema/core.ldif
include: file:///etc/openldap/schema/cosine.ldif
include: file:///etc/openldap/schema/inetorgperson.ldif
</code></pre>
<p>When I included my converted file, it would successfully apply it, then just
stop... I assumed at first that there was a syntax error, but there was no
error. Everything contained in the included LDIF was present in the DIT. It had
simply stopped.</p>
<p>After many frustrating attempts, and hours Googling, the result came down to...
there was an empty line at the end of the file. I couldn't find any
documentation about this behavior and identified it through dumb luck. For
anyone that comes across this I hope this solves your issue as well.</p>
