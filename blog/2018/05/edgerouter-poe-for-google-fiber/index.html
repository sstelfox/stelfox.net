I already owned a <a href=https://www.ubnt.com/edgemax/edgerouter-poe/>Ubiquiti EdgeRouter PoE 5</a> which has been battle tested at easily routing a gigabit worth of small packets.</p><p>When setting up my service, the representative I talked to told me I was able to use my own router, but I would still need to get a Google Fiber Network Box. I confirmed this with the staff who handed me the network box, informing me I just had to "put it into bridge mode". Turns out there is no bridge mode, and no you don't need the Fiber Box.</p><p>After much Googling and confirming those two points, I came across <a href=http://comptechrt.blogspot.com/2015/10/google-fiber-with-3rd-party.html>other</a> <a href=https://www.stevejenkins.com/blog/2015/11/replace-your-google-fiber-network-box-with-a-ubiquiti-edgerouter-lite/>people</a> have been in this situation <a href=https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/fiber/AbNh8ij72Mw/l0quYBiiCJ8J>before</a> and have written up their own very good documentation on very similar setups. A lot of the information is at least a year old so it was worth going over carefully, and didn't go quite as far as I'd like.</p><p>One thing I will say ahead of time. I'm not adventuring into the TV service as I don't have it. From the messages I read, if you want this a cheap Gigabit switch between your router and the fiber jack that you can additionally plug the TV box into will do the trick (but you want to avoid powering the jack with PoE if you go this route).</p><p>There was some discussion from an official Google representative in one of the many threads that made a passing mention they would switch to untagged traffic so I wanted to verify what was happening. For this I <a href=2018-05-13-quick-and-silent-gigabit-packet-interception>became the wire</a> and sniffed the traffic directly. The settings on the wire matched the contents of a deleted post from a Google representative early on in <a href=https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/fiber/AbNh8ij72Mw/l0quYBiiCJ8J>this thread</a> reproduced here for future reference:</p><blockquote><p>Here's the gory details if you really want to use your own router:</p><ol><li>Traffic in/out of the fiberjack is vlan tagged with vlan2.</li><li>DHCP traffic should have 802.1p bit = 2</li><li>IGMP traffic should have 802.1p bit = 6</li><li>All other internet traffic 802.1p bit = 3</li></ol><p>You can send data without the 802.1p bits but your performance will get throttled to something like 10Mbit.</p><p>NOTE: This data is subject to change. We are planning on changing the data in/out of the fiberjack to be untagged, which will then make it really easy for you to connect your own router.</p><p>A word of warning, most consumer routers don't have hardware forwarding (that is my feeble understanding) so you might not be happy with the performance on your network, and which will also probably affect tv service quality.</p></blockquote><p>One other piece of information that I gleaned from the traffic capture is that the IPv6 prefix length of /56. If you want to reproduce this, look into the DHCPv6 messages for a pair of solicit / request (actually a response but that is how it is labeled).</p><p>I had some initial concern about VLAN tagging as I suspected it may force software handling of all routed packets. The EdgeRouter PoE has hardware offloading for VLAN tagging available so this is not an issue for this router. For anyone using this as a reference for another router, you'll want to make sure yours supports this.</p><h2 id=basic-connectivity>Basic Connectivity</h2><p>The first task was to get basic IPv4 connectivity going. When I started the configuration my router was on version 1.9.1.1, which I upgraded to 1.10.1 <em>after</em> I finished all of the configuration. I didn't have any issues with the software, everything seemed very stable.</p><p>The basic connectivity just requires tagging outbound traffic with VLAN 2, to get the full speed the packets additionally need to have the correct 802.1q QoS tags. The one bonus we'll add that is totally unecessary is powering the jack with PoE since we're already going to messing with that interface.</p><p><em>Sidenote: If you want to play with egress values, changing after the fact requires editing of the <a href=/blog/2018/05/edgerouter-poe-for-google-fiber/#changing-the-egress-qos-value>config on disk and a full restart</a>. It's kind of a pain to go through a bunch of different options.</em></p><p>The EdgeRouter PoE doesn't seem to be able to adjust QoS settings based on the protocol (I could be wrong I didn't look into this too deeply, maybe the advanced traffic control stuff?), but since I don't have the TV service, I don't have the IGMP traffic to worry about. That just leaves DHCPv4 packets.</p><p>I confirmed that DHCPv4 will get an address when tagged with a QoS value of 3 (which is what the bulk traffic should be tagged with). Later on, I go into detail <a href=/blog/2018/05/edgerouter-poe-for-google-fiber/#initial-connectivity-time>about an issue</a> that I think could be potentially related to this but I haven't done additional testing.</p><p>I tried several mapping values for different types of traffic and settled on mapping everything to a QoS value of 3 (option 3 below). The mappings that I tried are:</p><ol><li>0:2</li><li>0:3</li><li>0:3 1:3 2:3 3:3 4:3 5:3 6:3 7:3</li><li>0:3 1:3 2:3 3:3 4:4 5:5 6:6 7:7</li><li>0:6</li></ol><p>To configure the router, connect the fiber jack to eth0 on the router and make sure the fiber jack doesn't have its external power connected. SSH into your router (this will depend on your current settings, or do a full reset and use the default static IP setting) and go into configure mode:</p><div class=highlight><div class=chroma><table class=lntable><tr><td class=lntd><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code><span class=lnt id=hl-0-1><a class=lnlinks href=#hl-0-1>1</a>

I was actually experiencing surprisingly long delays getting connectivity after changes. Part of this is that the PoE to the fiber jack isn't maintained while the router is rebooting, forcing the jack to boot as well, but a large portion of that is the IPv4 connectivity itself.</p><p>The timings I measured during a reboot were:</p><ul><li>1 minute 18 seconds to first ping of internal LAN interface</li><li>An additional 35 seconds before the SSH port was open</li><li>19 more seconds before logins were allowed</li><li>A further 33 seconds before the router saw the link from the fiber jack come up</li><li>22 seconds until IPv6 connectivity was established (internal hosts now have IPv6 internet)</li><li>An additional 3 minutes 46 seconds before the eth0.2 interface gets an IPv4 address and IPv4 connectivity is available.</li></ul><p>Total boot time: 5 minutes 53 seconds. That is pretty crazy and it's almost all waiting for an IPv4 address on the link. Either something is really slow on Google's end, or this delay is because the DHCP traffic is tagged with an incorrect QoS value (I haven't tested it).</p><p>Either way, reboots once setup are pretty rare and I can wait the almost six minutes without internet when it happens.</p><h2 id=mss-clamping>MSS Clamping</h2><p><a href=https://www.stevejenkins.com/blog/2015/11/replace-your-google-fiber-network-box-with-a-ubiquiti-edgerouter-lite/>Steve Jenkins</a>'s post has the most complete documentation on setting up the EdgeRouter (and makes his configs <a href=https://github.com/stevejenkins/UBNT-EdgeRouter-Example-Configs>available on GitHub</a>), but I was a tad confused about him using MSS clamping, which I've left out of my config.</p><p>MSS clamping is used to restrict MTU sizes through TCP headers, and is very useful when tunneling traffic or wrapping in an authentication mechanism such as PPPoE, MPLS, or GRE. During the crafting of packets, hosts won't be aware of the tunnel which will have its own MTU and packet overhead and thus can hit some performance snags.</p><p>With this config, we are at most adding 4 bytes to each packet as a VLAN tag but won't encounter a tunnel that will break a packet up into multiple tunneled packets when a packet is to large and rebuild it at the other exactly the same. Any fragmentation that occurs in transit will be visible to the MSS detection algorithms and handled correctly without the overhead or limitation of MSS clamping. If anything I'd expect it to slow down the connection slightly for large packets.</p><p>You can <a href=/blog/2018/05/edgerouter-poe-for-google-fiber/edgerouter-poe-google-fiber-example.conf>find the complete config I built up in this post here</a>.</p><h2 id=additional-references>Additional References</h2><ul><li><a href=https://community.ubnt.com/t5/EdgeRouter/Comcast-IPv6-issues-when-hwnat-enabled-on-ER-X/m-p/1850112#U1850112>https://community.ubnt.com/t5/EdgeRouter/Comcast-IPv6-issues-when-hwnat-enabled-on-ER-X/m-p/1850112#U1850112</a></li><li><a href=https://community.ubnt.com/t5/EdgeRouter/Updated-Google-Fiber-EdgeRouter-Lite-PoE-IPv4-amp-IPv6-config/td-p/1790440>https://community.ubnt.com/t5/EdgeRouter/Updated-Google-Fiber-EdgeRouter-Lite-PoE-IPv4-amp-IPv6-config/td-p/1790440</a></li><li><a href=https://community.ubnt.com/t5/EdgeRouter/IPv6-DHCPv6-and-DHCPv6-PD/td-p/1115361>https://community.ubnt.com/t5/EdgeRouter/IPv6-DHCPv6-and-DHCPv6-PD/td-p/1115361</a></li><li><a href=https://kazoo.ga/dhcpv6-pd-for-native-ipv6/>https://kazoo.ga/dhcpv6-pd-for-native-ipv6/</a></li><li><a href=https://community.ubnt.com/t5/EdgeRouter/The-generation-of-etc-radvd-conf-is-missing-my-configuration/td-p/1355531>https://community.ubnt.com/t5/EdgeRouter/The-generation-of-etc-radvd-conf-is-missing-my-configuration/td-p/1355531</a></li><li><a href=https://community.ubnt.com/t5/EdgeRouter/ERlite-1-5-upnp2-secure-mode/td-p/923222>https://community.ubnt.com/t5/EdgeRouter/ERlite-1-5-upnp2-secure-mode/td-p/923222</a></li><li><a href=https://flyovercountry.org/2014/02/google-fiber-gigabit-speeds-your-router-part-1-vlans/>https://flyovercountry.org/2014/02/google-fiber-gigabit-speeds-your-router-part-1-vlans/</a></li><li><a href=http://itnutt.com/how-to-bypass-google-fibers-network-box/>http://itnutt.com/how-to-bypass-google-fibers-network-box/</a></li><li><a href=https://netswat.com/blog/google-fiber-ubiquitis-edgerouter/>https://netswat.com/blog/google-fiber-ubiquitis-edgerouter/</a></li><li><a href=https://netswat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Edge-Setup-Interfacesv3.txt>https://netswat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Edge-Setup-Interfacesv3.txt</a></li><li><a href=https://netswat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/EdgeRouter-TVScript6.txt>https://netswat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/EdgeRouter-TVScript6.txt</a></li></ul></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg>
