include: file:///etc/openldap/schema/cosine.ldif
include: file:///etc/openldap/schema/inetorgperson.ldif
</code></pre><p>When I included my converted file, it would successfully apply it, then just stop... I assumed at first that there was a syntax error, but there was no error. Everything contained in the included LDIF was present in the DIT. It had simply stopped.</p><p>After many frustrating attempts, and hours Googling, the result came down to... There was an empty line at the end of the file. I couldn't find any documentation about this behavior and identified it through dumb luck. For anyone that comes across this I hope this solves your issue as well.</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg>
