couple of schema files, but no equivalent LDIF files. I found ways to convert
the file using <code>slapcat</code> and <code>slaptest</code> and the files were valid on their own.</p><p>I was specifically trying to bootstrap an OpenLDAP server, with it&rsquo;s schema,
from scratch for a CI/CD system to test against. To accomplish this I was
making use of the <code>include</code> directive in a configuration LDIF file and saw some
very odd behavior.</p><p>When I included the LDIF schema files that shipped with the software, I could
include multiple of them back to back like so:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>include: file:///etc/openldap/schema/core.ldif
include: file:///etc/openldap/schema/cosine.ldif
include: file:///etc/openldap/schema/inetorgperson.ldif
</code></pre><p>When I included my converted file, it would successfully apply it, then just
stop&mldr; I assumed at first that there was a syntax error, but there was no
error. Everything contained in the included LDIF was present in the DIT. It had
simply stopped.</p><p>After many frustrating attempts, and hours Googling, the result came down to&mldr;
there was an empty line at the end of the file. I couldn&rsquo;t find any
documentation about this behavior and identified it through dumb luck. For
anyone that comes across this I hope this solves your issue as well.</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg>
