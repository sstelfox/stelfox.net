of your DNS requests to a trusted server. In an age when airports, and coffee
shops are outsourcing &lsquo;free wifi&rsquo; to corporate entities that are likely
harvesting as much data as they can this is a nice addition. I largely use VPNs
when connected to these access points which provides at least as good
protection as DNS-over-TLS which has caused me to largely overlook this
development.</p><p>When I found out that Android 9 natively supports this through the &lsquo;Private
DNS&rsquo; feature I got significantly more interested. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to dictate
what DNS server my phone used, not for privacy reasons but rather to provide
another layer of security when not connected to my VPN. When you&rsquo;re in control
of your DNS server you can blacklist known malicious domains and as an added
bonus the worst of the ad and tracking networks.</p><p>Turns out DNS-over-TLS is incredibly simple. It makes no changes to normal DNS
packets, it just wraps the TCP queries in a TLS tunnel with a preconfigured
server address for certificate validation.</p><p>I use unbound for my DNS server of choice which natively supports exposing a
TLS protected port, but with a very limited config. My preferred choice of
dealing with this is instead to use Nginx to proxy locally to unbound, allowing
me to ensure the TLS config matches current best practices and limits access to
the servers TLS private key to a single service.</p><p>The downside of using Nginx is that you lose the ability to log which internet
addresses are making requests (as the stream access_log directive doesn&rsquo;t seem
to be working for the packaged Nginx server). Since this is an unauthenticated
service I&rsquo;m slightly concerned about anonymous use and abuse but will address
that if it ever becomes an issue.</p><p>First off we need to ensure we have a working local resolver on our host. I&rsquo;ll
use unbound here as its my preference but this will work just as well with Bind
or any other DNS resolver that supports TCP queries. If you want to use another
server, just skip past the unbound config to the Nginx section.</p><h2 id=unbound>Unbound</h2><pre tabindex=0><code>dnf install unbound -y</code></pre><p>I clear out some of the garbage default files that ship with the package, and
perform the automated control key creation:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>rm -f /etc/unbound/{conf.d,keys.d,local.d}/*

blindly used. Make sure you start and enable the service:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>systemctl start unbound.service
systemctl enable unbound.service</code></pre><p>Perform various queries against the service to ensure it&rsquo;s working as intended:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>dig +tcp google.com @::1
dig +tcp reddit.com @::1
dig +tcp stelfox.net @::1</code></pre><p>If you get reasonable responses from those queries then we have a working
resolver. The next step is to add our TLS layer with Nginx.</p><h2 id=nginx>Nginx</h2><p>With a resolver setup the next bit is to setup Nginx to proxy requests to the
resolver. You need to have a trusted TLS certificate and key for your server&rsquo;s
domain name. Let&rsquo;s Encrypt works great for this and I use both an ECDSA
cert/key pair and an RSA cert/key pair but you can use one or the other if that
is your preference. I&rsquo;ll cover requesting these certificates in a future post,
in the mean time there are plenty of existing Let&rsquo;s Encrypt tutorials.</p><p>This can be a bit tricky as anyone reading this might have an Nginx config in
place already. It&rsquo;ll be up to you to merge this config with yours. To assist
with this merging I&rsquo;ve kept the Nginx config as minimal while still being
completely functional as possible and avoided using includes to increase the
clarity of the config.</p><p>On Fedora 28 you&rsquo;ll need both the <code>nginx</code> and the <code>nginx-mod-stream</code> package.
After installing them both you&rsquo;ll want to place the following config to
<code>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</code>.</p><pre tabindex=0><code># /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
  }
}</code></pre><p>The SSL configuration is largely what Mozilla currently recommends for a
&lsquo;Modern&rsquo; config. Any client that supports DNS-over-TLS is new enough that
they&rsquo;ll have access to modern queries. You&rsquo;ll need to put your key and
certificates in the appropriate locations for that config.</p><p>With that in place start up the server:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>systemctl start nginx.service
systemctl enable nginx.service</code></pre><p>You&rsquo;ll need to allow <code>953/tcp</code> through your firewall and will likely need to
make changes to your SELinux policy to allow Nginx to listen on that port.</p><p>I haven&rsquo;t found a good way to directly test the resolver using command line
clients but by configuring my Android phone towards my server and temporarily
adding the following to my unbound server config I can that queries being made
and responded to appropriately:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>log-queries: yes
log-replies: yes</code></pre><p>The next steps are on you. Configure unbound with your domain blacklists of
choice and voila additional privacy and security for those times when VPNs are
to power hungry.</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg>
