  <div class="post-content"><p>I recently moved to an area with Google Fiber and jumped on the chance to have
a cheap and fast connection, and I didn't need to sell my soul to certain other
companies. I already owned a Ubiquiti EdgeRouter PoE 5 which has been battle
tested at easily routing a gigabit worth of small packets.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>When setting up my service, the representative I talked to told me I was able
to use my own router, but I would still need to get a Google Fiber Network Box.
I confirmed this with the staff who handed me the network box, informing me I
just had to &quot;put it into bridge mode&quot;. Turns out there is no bridge mode, and
no you don't need the Fiber Box.</p>
<p>After much Googling and confirming those two points, I came across <a href="https://comptechrt.blogspot.com/2015/10/google-fiber-with-3rd-party.html">other</a>
<a href="https://community.ui.com/questions/Comcast-IPv6-issues-when-hwnat-enabled-on-ER-X/c4d049b3-b4a1-46a7-a157-72b54c3403a5">people</a> have been in this situation <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/fiber/AbNh8ij72Mw/l0quYBiiCJ8J">before</a> and have written up their
own very good documentation on very similar setups. A lot of the information is
at least a year old so it was worth going over carefully, and didn't go quite
as far as I'd like.</p>
<p>One thing I will say ahead of time. I'm not adventuring into the TV service as
I don't have it. From the messages I read, if you want this a cheap Gigabit
switch between your router and the fiber jack that you can additionally plug
the TV box into will do the trick (but you want to avoid powering the jack with
PoE if you go this route).</p>
<p>There was some discussion from an official Google representative in one of the
many threads that made a passing mention they would switch to untagged traffic
so I wanted to verify what was happening. For this I <a href="https://stelfox.net/blog/2018/quick-and-silent-gigabit-packet-interception/">became the wire</a> and
sniffed the traffic directly. The settings on the wire matched the contents of
a deleted post from a Google representative early on in <a href="https://support.google.com/fiber/forum/AAAAiDLuNlIAbNh8ij72Mw/">this thread</a>
reproduced here for future reference:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's the gory details if you really want to use your own router:</p>
<ol>
<li>Traffic in/out of the fiberjack is vlan tagged with vlan2.</li>
<li>DHCP traffic should have 802.1p bit = 2</li>
<li>IGMP traffic should have 802.1p bit = 6</li>
<li>All other internet traffic 802.1p bit = 3</li>
</ol>
<p>You can send data without the 802.1p bits but your performance will get
throttled to something like 10Mbit.</p>
<p>NOTE:  This data is subject to change.  We are planning on changing the data
in/out of the fiberjack to be untagged, which will then make it really easy
for you to connect your own router.</p>
<p>A word of warning, most consumer routers don't have hardware forwarding (that
is my feeble understanding) so you might not be happy with the performance on
your network, and which will also probably affect tv service quality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One other piece of information that I gleaned from the traffic capture is that
the IPv6 prefix length of /56. If you want to reproduce this, look into the
DHCPv6 messages for a pair of solicit / request (actually a response but that
is how it is labeled).</p>
<p>I had some initial concern about VLAN tagging as I suspected it may force
software handling of all routed packets. The EdgeRouter PoE has hardware
offloading for VLAN tagging available so this is not an issue for this router.
For anyone using this as a reference for another router, you'll want to make
sure yours supports this.</p>
<h2 id="basic-connectivity">Basic Connectivity</h2>
<p>The first task was to get basic IPv4 connectivity going. When I started the
configuration my router was on version 1.9.1.1, which I upgraded to 1.10.1
<em>after</em> I finished all of the configuration. I didn't have any issues with the
software, everything seemed very stable.</p>
<p>The basic connectivity just requires tagging outbound traffic with VLAN 2, to
get the full speed the packets additionally need to have the correct 802.1q QoS
tags. The one bonus we'll add that is totally unecessary is powering the jack
with PoE since we're already going to messing with that interface.</p>
<p><em>Sidenote: If you want to play with egress values, changing after the fact
requires editing of the <a href="https://stelfox.net/blog/2018/edgerouter-poe-on-google-fiber/#changing-the-egress-qos-value">config on disk and a full restart</a>. It's kind of a
pain to go through a bunch of different options.</em></p>
<p>The EdgeRouter PoE doesn't seem to be able to adjust QoS settings based on the
protocol (I could be wrong I didn't look into this too deeply, maybe the
advanced traffic control stuff?), but since I don't have the TV service, I
don't have the IGMP traffic to worry about. That just leaves DHCPv4 packets.</p>
<p>I confirmed that DHCPv4 will get an address when tagged with a QoS value of 3
(which is what the bulk traffic should be tagged with). Later on, I go into
detail <a href="https://stelfox.net/blog/2018/edgerouter-poe-on-google-fiber/#initial-connectivity-time">about an issue</a> that I think could be potentially related to this
but I haven't done additional testing.</p>
<p>I tried several mapping values for different types of traffic and settled on
mapping everything to a QoS value of 3 (option 3 below). The mappings that I
tried are:</p>
<ol>
<li>0:2</li>
<li>0:3</li>
<li>0:3 1:3 2:3 3:3 4:3 5:3 6:3 7:3</li>
<li>0:3 1:3 2:3 3:3 4:4 5:5 6:6 7:7</li>
<li>0:6</li>
</ol>
<p>To configure the router, connect the fiber jack to eth0 on the router and make
sure the fiber jack doesn't have its external power connected. SSH into your
router (this will depend on your current settings, or do a full reset and use
the default static IP setting) and go into configure mode:</p>
<pre><code>configure
</code></pre>
<p>There are a lot of changes that need to be made, the one thing you'll want to
double check is the name of your firewall rules which should have already been
setup. By default they get named <code>WAN_IN</code>, <code>WANv6_IN</code>, <code>WAN_LOCAL</code>, and
<code>WANv6_LOCAL</code> and I didn't need to make any changes to them to get things
working. Because there are so many changes from the default WAN settings, we're
going to start from a clean slate:</p>
<pre><code>delete interfaces ethernet eth0
</code></pre>
<p>Now we need to setup the physical connection details again and we'll add the
PoE configuration to power the jack. Please note that these will not go into
effect until we commit them (which we're going to wait to do until later).</p>
<pre><code>edit interfaces ethernet eth0
set description "Google Fiber Jack"
set duplex auto
set speed auto
set poe output 48v
exit
</code></pre>
<p>We're now going to want to create the VLAN interface on eth0, which is done
through the <code>vif</code> sub-commands off the interface. While not necessary yet,
we'll also place the IPv6 firewalls in place, even if you don't intend to using
IPv6 having these in place can prevent accidents if it ever gets enabled.</p>
<pre><code>edit interfaces ethernet eth0 vif 2
set description Internet
set address dhcp
set egress-qos "0:3 1:3 2:3 3:3 4:3 5:3 6:3 7:3"
set firewall in name WAN_IN
set firewall in ipv6-name WANv6_IN
set firewall local name WAN_LOCAL
set firewall local name WANv6_IN
exit
</code></pre>
<p>To ensure the routing performance is as good as it can be, we want to ensure
the relevant hardware offload settings are configured:</p>
<pre><code>edit system offload
set ipv4 forwarding enable
set ipv4 vlan enable
exit
</code></pre>
<p>At this point we need to commit the change to allow the VLAN interface to be
created. Routing won't work yet, but this will power the jack and get it
booting. To get basic routing working the outbound interface for NAT will also
need to be updated and recommitted. You'll want to double check your NAT rule
number matches mine (5010).</p>
<pre><code>commit
set service nat rule 5010 outbound-interface eth0.2
commit
</code></pre>
<p>Now you'll have to wait a while for everything to come up, which can be <a href="https://stelfox.net/blog/2018/edgerouter-poe-on-google-fiber/#initial-connectivity-time">up to
five minutes</a> but your IPv4 connectivity should be all set.</p>
<p>I also setup IPv6 separately using DHCPv6-PD, giving a separate /64 network to
each of my internal networks. I'm going to leave that for another post though.</p>
<h2 id="changing-the-egress-qos-value">Changing the egress-qos Value</h2>
<p>If you want to change the <code>egress-qos</code> value after the VLAN interface comes up
you'll be presented with the following error message:</p>
<pre><code>admin@ubnt-router:~$ configure
[edit]
admin@ubnt-router# set interfaces ethernet eth0 vif 2 egress-qos "0:2"
[edit]
admin@ubnt-router# commit
egress-qos can only be set at vlan creation for 2

Commit failed
[edit]
</code></pre>
<p>To actually change this value, you need to switch to root, and use <code>vi</code> to edit
the <code>/config/config.boot</code> file and reboot the router itself.</p>
<h2 id="initial-connectivity-time">Initial Connectivity Time</h2>
<p>Several time during the course of testing this I assumed I had broken my
connectivity while testing. I was actually experiencing surprisingly long
delays getting connectivity after changes. Part of this is that the PoE to the
fiber jack isn't maintained while the router is rebooting, forcing the jack to
boot as well, but a large portion of that is the IPv4 connectivity itself.</p>
<p>The timings I measured during a reboot were:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 minute 18 seconds to first ping of internal LAN interface</li>
<li>An additional 35 seconds before the SSH port was open</li>
<li>19 more seconds before logins were allowed</li>
<li>A further 33 seconds before the router saw the link from the fiber jack come
up</li>
<li>22 seconds until IPv6 connectivity was established (internal hosts now have
IPv6 internet)</li>
<li>An additional 3 minutes 46 seconds before the eth0.2 interface gets an IPv4
address and IPv4 connectivity is available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Total boot time: 5 minutes 53 seconds. That is pretty crazy and it's almost all
waiting for an IPv4 address on the link. Either something is really slow on
Google's end, or this delay is because the DHCP traffic is tagged with an
incorrect QoS value (I haven't tested it).</p>
<p>Either way, reboots once setup are pretty rare and I can wait the almost six
minutes without internet when it happens.</p>
<h2 id="mss-clamping">MSS Clamping</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.stevejenkins.com/blog/2015/11/replace-your-google-fiber-network-box-with-a-ubiquiti-edgerouter-lite/">Steve Jenkins</a>'s post has the most complete documentation on setting up the
EdgeRouter (and makes his configs <a href="https://github.com/stevejenkins/UBNT-EdgeRouter-Example-Configs">available on GitHub</a>), but I was a tad
confused about him using MSS clamping, which I've left out of my config.</p>
<p>MSS clamping is used to restrict MTU sizes through TCP headers, and is very
useful when tunneling traffic or wrapping in an authentication mechanism such
as PPPoE, MPLS, or GRE. During the crafting of packets, hosts won't be aware of
the tunnel which will have its own MTU and packet overhead and thus can hit
some performance snags.</p>
<p>With this config, we are at most adding 4 bytes to each packet as a VLAN tag
but won't encounter a tunnel that will break a packet up into multiple tunneled
packets when a packet is to large and rebuild it at the other exactly the same.
Any fragmentation that occurs in transit will be visible to the MSS detection
algorithms and handled correctly without the overhead or limitation of MSS
clamping. If anything I'd expect it to slow down the connection slightly for
large packets.</p>
