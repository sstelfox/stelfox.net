                <p>I like getting unopinionated feedback on the quality of the code I write.
Sometimes I can get this from other developers but they tend to get annoyed
being asked after every commit whether they consider it an improvement.</p>
<p>There are a few utilities for Ruby codebases such as <a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/flay">flay</a>, <a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/flog">flog</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop">rubocop</a> as well as hosted services such as <a href="https://codeclimate.com/">Code Climate</a> that can help
you identify chunks of code that can use some work.</p>
<p>While not directly connected to the quality of the code, I also make use of
<a href="http://yardoc.org/">yard</a> and <a href="https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov">simplecov</a> to assess documentation and test coverage of the
codebases I work on.</p>
<p>Using the tools means very little without some reference or understanding
doesn&rsquo;t get you very far. For a while I&rsquo;ve been using flog and only comparing
the numbers against other codebases I control. I finally googled around and
found a <a href="http://jakescruggs.blogspot.com/2008/08/whats-good-flog-score.html">blog post</a> by a developer named Jake Scruggs from a while ago
(2008).</p>
<p>The blog post includes a rough table for assessing scores on individual methods
reported from the flog utility. From what I can tell the ranges are still
pretty accurate. I&rsquo;ve tweaked the descriptions a bit to fit my mental
understanding a bit but the table is here:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Method Score</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0   - 10</td>
<td>Awesome</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10  - 20</td>
<td>Decent</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>20  - 40</td>
<td>Might need refactoring</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>40  - 60</td>
<td>Should probably review</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>60  - 100</td>
<td>Danger</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100 - 200</td>
<td>Raise the alarm</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200+</td>
<td>Seriously what are you doing!?</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I wanted to extend this with a second table providing a scale for the overall
method average with a more aggressive scale (an individual couple of methods
can be justifiably complex but the overall code base shouldn&rsquo;t be riddled with
them) but had a hard time working it out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen some awesome code bases with a score of 6.4 on average, some bad
larger ones with 7.8. Even some mediocre ones around a score of 10.6.</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;ll have to think more on it&hellip;</p>
