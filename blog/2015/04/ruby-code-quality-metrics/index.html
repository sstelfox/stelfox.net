Sometimes I can get this from other developers but they tend to get annoyed
being asked after every commit whether they consider it an improvement.</p><p>There are a few utilities for Ruby codebases such as <a href=https://github.com/seattlerb/flay>flay</a>, <a href=https://github.com/seattlerb/flog>flog</a>, and
<a href=https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop>rubocop</a> as well as hosted services such as <a href=https://codeclimate.com/>Code Climate</a> that can help
you identify chunks of code that can use some work.</p><p>While not directly connected to the quality of the code, I also make use of
<a href=http://yardoc.org/>yard</a> and <a href=https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov>simplecov</a> to assess documentation and test coverage of the
codebases I work on.</p><p>Using the tools means very little without some reference or understanding
doesn&rsquo;t get you very far. For a while I&rsquo;ve been using flog and only comparing
the numbers against other codebases I control. I finally googled around and
found a <a href=http://jakescruggs.blogspot.com/2008/08/whats-good-flog-score.html>blog post</a> by a developer named Jake Scruggs from a while ago
(2008).</p><p>The blog post includes a rough table for assessing scores on individual methods
reported from the flog utility. From what I can tell the ranges are still
pretty accurate. I&rsquo;ve tweaked the descriptions a bit to fit my mental
understanding a bit but the table is here:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Method Score</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0 - 10</td><td>Awesome</td></tr><tr><td>10 - 20</td><td>Decent</td></tr><tr><td>20 - 40</td><td>Might need refactoring</td></tr><tr><td>40 - 60</td><td>Should probably review</td></tr><tr><td>60 - 100</td><td>Danger</td></tr><tr><td>100 - 200</td><td>Raise the alarm</td></tr><tr><td>200+</td><td>Seriously what are you doing!?</td></tr></tbody></table><p>I wanted to extend this with a second table providing a scale for the overall
method average with a more aggressive scale (an individual couple of methods
can be justifiably complex but the overall code base shouldn&rsquo;t be riddled with
them) but had a hard time working it out.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve seen some awesome code bases with a score of 6.4 on average, some bad
larger ones with 7.8. Even some mediocre ones around a score of 10.6.</p><p>I guess I&rsquo;ll have to think more on it&mldr;</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg>
