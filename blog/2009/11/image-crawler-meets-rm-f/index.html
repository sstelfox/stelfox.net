            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I wrote a simple web crawler that archived any images it found from a site with
a large number of backgrounds. I wanted to have rolling backgrounds that almost
never repeated.</p>
<p>I let my crawler go and stopped it after a 24 hour period. I ran <code>ls</code> on  the
directory the images were being saved in to see the results and my ssh session
locked up&hellip; Or so I thought. I hit Ctrl-C and nothing happened&hellip; So I closed
my window and opened a new one.</p>
<p>Maybe there was a file name that hit some weird glitch in <code>ls</code> causing it too
lock up. Not a big deal I can start from scratch. I switched to the directory
and ran an <code>rm -f *</code> and was greeted with this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#c9d1d9;background-color:#0d1117;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>/bin/rm: Argument list too long.
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Wait what? All I get was this irritating and slightly elusive error message. So
the * was being expanded, and making the list too long? To be sure I started
hunting in the man pages. <code>man rm</code> recommended me to <code>info coreutils 'rm invocation'</code>. I read through and couldn&rsquo;t find any limitations or warnings that
might relate to the problem. The only thing I could find in there was a line
that said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GNU &lsquo;rm&rsquo;, like every program that uses the &lsquo;getopt&rsquo; function to parse its
arguments&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moving on&hellip; getopt is parsing it&rsquo;s options&hellip; man and info pages on getopt
don&rsquo;t really reveal anything&hellip;</p>
<p>After some creative Googling I found the answer: getopt&rsquo;s argument limit is
1024. How many files did I have? I wanted to give ls one more try&hellip; I
typed it in and sure enough console froze&hellip; Or did it? I walked away and
did other things. When I came back I had a list of files longer than my
console buffer. I was smarter the second time around: <code>ls | wc -l</code>. After
about five minutes it came back again with just the number.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>177654</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I needed to clean up that directory and rm wasn&rsquo;t going to help me. `find . |
xargs rm -f1 and&hellip;. Victory! The directory is clean and happy again. Now I&rsquo;ll
just have to figure out how to cut down the number of files, or at the very
least organize them into more managable chunks&hellip;</p>
