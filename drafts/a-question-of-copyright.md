title: A Question of Copyright
---

A recent post on ask slashdot [asking how to explain copyright to the next
generation][1] cemented a series of disparate thoughts that have bouncing in my
head recently. I must admit this is likely more to do with recently reading
Cory Doctorow's "[Information Doesn't Want to Be Free][2]", McKenzie Wark "[The
Hacker Manifesto][3]", and Paul Mason's "[Postcapitalism: A Guide to Our
Future][4]".

All three of the books I've mentioned previously have at their core the idea
that ownership over information is the modern powerbase of economics in
different forms. The Hacker Manifesto explaining in detail the evolution of
controlled resources from land, to industry, and now with information being the
primary drivers of economy and in turn political pressure and power.

Wark goes into a lot more detail and I highly recommend it the read if you
enjoy philosophical treaties, but for this post it is sufficient to say that
those who can control the flow and accessibility of information are dominant in
our societal power structures right now (think Google, Apple, Verizon, and
Comcast), and are equivalent to land baron's in feudal times.

Notes to self:

* Cover the transition to post capitalism, with producing new information being
  effectively effortless to produce (copy / paste / transfer) and the
  distribution of it costing almost nothing, the only actual cost being the
  original source production.
* Transition in to Doctorow's dissertation on DRM and how companies are trying
  to lock content away in isolated forms to add political and legal threat to
  effectively zero-cost production as well making companies mandatory middlemen
  that hurt and consume profits
* Bring up some of the failures of DRM
* Touch on net neutrality and the power that it will grant to the vectoralist
  overlords on the ability to gate keep and enforce arbitrary rules that
  further restrict the commons ability to reproduce information
* Contrast the copying, limitations, etc in the ask slashdot story and discuss
  whether obtaining an unrestricted copy of something you already own is moral
  and what legal ramifications might come from this expected utility of
  something you've purchased
* Bring in effects of the First-sale doctrine and how DRM and digital
  information currently removes the ability of people to excercise it
* Turn back to postcapitalism's
