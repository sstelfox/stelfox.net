The quote that got me interested in this was from a user on Hacker News with
the handle 'Jon Lowtek':

I wasn't aware of the term `cabinet noir` before and it got me interested in
the history of the subject. Perhaps after listening to too many investigative
podcasts I wanted to try my hand at doing an investigation myself.
