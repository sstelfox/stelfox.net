title: Personal Notes

This section contains notes on various services and systems I've explored or
setup. These are frequently stream of conciousness notes and may have dead
ends, multiple attempts, or be outdated. I periodically go through them and
attempt to rewrite them to make them more consumable by others and myself.

I hope these can help guide people on their own attempts to understand the
services that they host. Please always double check the facts and don't take a
random netizen's personal assessment will match your use cases.
