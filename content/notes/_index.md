title: Various Notes
---

When learning new systems, reading interesting articles, or working through complex topics I keep extensive notes in a personal knowledge base. Frequently these noes are written in a short hand that isn't easily publishable. As I re-encounter information I've written about before the notes get progressively more complete and worth publishing.

I think there is a lot of potential in my personal notes for other people educating themselves about some of these topics. I've made a concerted effort to start publishing more of this information and make the process of migrating these notes technically easier to accomplish. There are times when information may be duplicated from my blog posts, though in different forms. Generally a blog will involve how I came to a conclusion and with additional context and background, while my notes will generally include just the bullet points, commands, and configurations sufficient to accomplish the goal.

Many of these notes are specific to versions of software that may be outdated and not all of my notes have accurate dates reflecting when I took those notes. I urge you to consider whether the software or topic might have significantly changed since its publication date and where appropriate double check my recommendations and configurations.
