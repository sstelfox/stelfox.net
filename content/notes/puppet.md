## Puppet Master / Server
### Installation

```
yum install puppet puppet-server -y
```

And configure the puppet master like so:

The following file is `/etc/puppet/puppet.conf`:

```ini
[master]
  confdir = /etc/puppet
  vardir = /var/lib/puppet
  logdir = /var/log/puppet

  # be removed without causing harm (although it might result in spurious
  # service restarts).
  statedir = /var/lib/puppet/state

  # Where Puppet PID files are kept.
  rundir = /var/run/puppet

  # Whether to just print a manifest to stdout and exit. Only makes sense when
  # used interactively. Takes into account arguments specified on the CLI.
  #genmanifest = false

  # Whether to use colors when logging to the console.  Valid values are
  # `ansi` (equivalent to `true`), `html`, and `false`, which produces no color.
  color = ansi

  # Whether to create the necessary user and group that puppet agent will run
  # as.
  #mkusers = false

  # Whether Puppet should manage the owner, group, and mode of files it uses
  # internally

  # process.
  #path = none

  # An extra search path for Puppet. This is only useful for those files that

  # directory is in Ruby's search path

  # referenced with `import` statements to exist. This setting was primarily
  # designed for use with commit hooks for parse-checking.

  # and methods. This can be used as a coarse-grained authorization system for

  # The environment Puppet is running in. For clients (e.g., `puppet agent`)
