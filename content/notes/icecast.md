title: IceCast
---

***Note: This page is quite old and is likely out of date. My opinions may have
also changed dramatically since this was written. It is here as a reference
until I get around to updating it.***

While it's described and primarily used as an audio streaming server, it would
be more accurate to describe it as a media streaming server as it's perfectly
capable of rebroadcasting video streams with or without audio.

## Setup Process

As of this writing Fedora 16 comes with Icecast version 2.3.2, the associated
documentation can be found on the Icecast website. I found some
documentation had been removed rather than updated along with the software and
that documentation can be found in version 2.0.1's documentation.

### Networking

Setup a dedicated IP for use by the Icecast server (this is optional but a good
practice even if it's just an internal address). You'll want to note this down
for what the server will bind it's addresses to later on.

For the purposes of this example configuration I'm using `eth0:1` interface
with an IP Address of 192.168.20.45 configured like so in
`/etc/sysconfig/network-script/ifcfg-eth0:1`

```
# eth0:1 - For Icecast Server
DEVICE="eth0:1"
NM_CONTROLLED="no"
ONBOOT="yes"
BOOTPROTO="static"

IPADDR="192.168.20.45"
NETMASK="255.255.255.0"
NETWORK="192.168.20.0"
BROADCAST="192.168.20.255"

IPV4_FAILURE_FATAL="yes"
IPV6_AUTOCONF="no"
IPV6INIT="no"

NAME="IceCast Interface"
```

Setup an A/CNAME record pointing at the server that will be hosting the Icecast
server, take note of this as it will be needed for the hostname param in the
configuration file. This example will use streams.example.org for the hostname.

### Firewall

Add the following [IPTables][3] rules:

```
-A SERVICES -d 192.168.20.45 -m tcp -p tcp --dport 8000 -j ACCEPT
-A SERVICES -d 192.168.20.45 -m tcp -p tcp --dport 8001 -j ACCEPT
```

### Setup the chroot Environment

The configuration I have here uses a chrooted environment within
`/usr/share/icecast`. By default it isn't fully setup.

```
mkdir /usr/share/icecast/log
chown -R icecast:icecast /usr/share/icecast
rm -rf /var/log/icecast
ln -s /usr/share/icecast/log/ /var/log/icecast
```

### Installation & Configuration

```
yum install icecast -y
```

Replace `/etc/icecast.xml` with the following minimized (read comments and
mount points removed) configuration. You'll need to change the values,
especially [passwords][4] listed in the configuration before making it live.

```xml
<icecast>
  <hostname>streams.example.org</hostname>

    <relay-password>hackme</relay-password>
    <admin-user>admin</admin-user>
    <admin-password>hackme</admin-password>
  </authentication>
</icecast>
```

Icecast hasn't been ported over to systemd yet so you mind as well use the old
configuration options to set it to start up on each boot:

```
chkconfig icecast on
service icecast start
```

If you configured everything properly you now have a happy Icecast server ready
to have a source authenticate to it and listeners receive it.

## Example Mount Definitions

### LiveDJ with Automation Fallback

The following configuration provides a public and a hidden mount. If there is a
live DJ authenticated and streaming content it will pull users out of the
automated stream and to listen to the live DJ, if the automated DJ goes down it
will play silence but won't kill the stream. This requires that you put a file
in the web directory named 'silence.ogg'.

You can download the one [I use here][5].  With this you'll want to use the URL
`http://streams.example.org/radio.ogg.m3u` to access the stream.

```xml
<mount>
  <mount-name>/automation.ogg</mount-name>

  <username>automation</username>
  <password>robot-password-hackme</password>

  <fallback-mount>/silence.ogg</fallback-mount>

## Using Icecast stream in HTML5

### Audio

Here is a snippet of HTML5 for connecting to the stream
`http://streams.example.org:8000/radio.ogg` with some javascript controls,
pretty straight forward. The loop is included in case the stream dies or is
currently in fallback mode to a file.

```html

    This flag turns on the icecast2 fileserver from which static files can be
    served. All files are served relative to the path specified in the

    that requests for the images on the status page are retrievable.

    This service should not be used for general file serving, use a service
    designed for that task such as Apache.
  -->
  <fileserve>1</fileserve>

  <!--
    This optional setting allows for the administrator of the server to override
    the default server identification. The default is icecast followed by a
    version number and most will not care to change it however this setting will
    change that. 
  -->
  <server-id>Icecast 2.3.2</server-id>

  <!--
    This is an undocumented setting, it probably gets announced to the icecast
    directory and defaults to "Earth" the value of this is also visible on the
    Icecast Administration page.
  -->
  <location>Earth</location>

  <!--
    An optional mountpoint setting to be used when shoutcast DSP compatible
    clients connect. The default global setting is /stream but can be overridden
    here to use an alternative name which may include an extension that some
    clients require for certain formats.

    Defining this within a listen-socket group tells icecast that this port and
    the subsequent port are to be used for shoutcast compatible source clients.
    This is an alternative to the shoutcast-compat approach as this implicitly
    defines the second listening socket and allows for specifying multiple
    sockets using different mountpoints for shoutcast source clients.

    The shoutcast-mount outside of a listen-socket group is the global setting of
    the mountpoint to use. 
  -->
  <shoutcast-mount>/stream</shoutcast-mount>

  <!--
    The listen-sockets define the ports and addresses that the daemon will listen
    on. Best practice dictates that you bind a service only to the IP addresses
    that you want the service to listen on. Without specifying one Icecast will
    listen on all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses the host is aware of.
  -->
  <listen-socket>
    <!--
      An optional IP address that can be used to bind to a specific network card.
      If not supplied, then it will bind to all interfaces. 
    -->
    <bind-address>192.168.20.45</bind-address>

      configuration. Refer to it's documentation else where in this config

  </listen-socket>
  <listen-socket>
    <bind-address>192.168.20.45</bind-address>
    <port>8001</port>

    <!--
      This optional flag will indicate that this port will operate in
      'shoutcast-compatibility' mode. Due to major differences in the source client
      connection protocol, if you wish to use any of the shoutcast DJ tools, you
      will need to configure at least one socket as shoutcast-compatible. Note that
      when in this mode, only source clients (and specifically shoutcast source
      clients) will be able to attach to this port. All listeners may connect to any
      of the ports defined without this flag. Also, for proper Shoutcast DSP
      compatibility, you must define a listen socket with a port one less than the
      one defined as 'shoutcast-compat'. This means if you define 8001 as
      shoutcast-compat, then you will need to define a listen port of 8000 and it
      must not also be defined as shoutcast-compat.

    The interval (in seconds) of how often to update the list of streams

    often (such as an internet radio station) it might be a good idea to
    increase this up to something like 10 or 15 minutes.

    master-username:
    This is the username that has been configured on the master server that the
    slave will use to authenticate. This defaults to 'relay' on both sides and
    is optional.

    master-password:
    This is the password that has been configured on the master server that the
    slave will use to authenticate.

    relays-on-demand:
    When this is set the slave will only connect to a master's stream to
    rebroadcast it if the slave has at least one listener. Setting this avoids
    using bandwidth unecessarily.

    If only specific mountpoints need to be relayed, then you can configure an
    Icecast slave with a "Specific Mountpoint Relay". Using a Specific
    Mountpoint Relay, only those mountpoints specified will be relayed. This
    only needs to be configured on the Icecast slaves.

    server:
    This is the IP or domain name for the server which contains the mountpoint
    to be relayed (The master server).

    port:
    This is the TCP Port for the server which contains the mountpoint to be
    relayed (The master server).

    mount:
    The mountpoint located on the remote server. If you are relaying a shoutcast
    stream, this should be a '/' or '/;name'. 

    local-mount:
    The name to use for the local mountpoint. This is what the mount will be
    named on the relaying server. By default the remote mountpoint name is used. 

    username:
    This is the username the slave will use to authenticate to the remote
    (master) server. Usually this is 'relay'.

    password:
    This is the password the slave will use to authenticate to the remote
    (master) server.

    on-demand:
    An on-demand relay will only retrieve the stream if there are listeners
    requesting the stream. This is useful in cases where you want to limit
    bandwidth when no one is listening. 

    relay-shoutcast-metadata:
    If you are relaying a Shoutcast stream, you may want to specify this
    indicator to also relay the metadata (song titles) that are part of the
    Shoutcast data stream. By default this is enabled but it is up to the
    remote server on whether it sends any.

    This section contains the settings which apply only to a specific mountpoint

    The purpose of the mount definition is to state certain information that can

    incoming stream.

    A mount does not need to be stated for each incoming source although you may
    want to specific certain settings like the maximum number of listeners or a
    mountpoint specific username/password. As a general rule, only define what
    you need to but each mount definition needs at least the mount-name.

      This optional value specifies a mountpoint that clients are automatically
      moved to if the source shuts down or is not streaming at the time a
      listener connects. Only one can be listed in each mount and should refer
      to another mountpoint on the same server that is streaming in the same
      streaming format.

      If clients cannot fallback to another mountpoint, due to a missing
      fallback-mount or it states a mountpoint that is just not available, then
      those clients will be disconnected. If clients are falling back to a
      mountpoint and the fallback-mount is not actively streaming but defines a
      fallback-mount itself then those clients may be moved there instead. This
      multi-level fallback allows clients to cascade several mountpoints.

      A fallback mount can also state a file that is located in webroot. This is
      useful for playing a pre-recorded file in the case of a stream going down.
      It will repeat until either the listener disconnects or a stream comes
      back available and takes the listeners back. As per usual, the file format
      should match the stream format, failing to do so may cause problems with
      playback.

      Note that the fallback file is not timed so be careful if you intend to
      relay this. They are fine on slave streams but don't use them on master
      streams, if you do then the relay will consume stream data at a faster
      rate and the listeners on the relay would eventually get kicked off.

      For non-Ogg streams like MP3, the metadata that is inserted into the stream
      often has no defined character set. We have traditionally assumed UTF8 as
      it allows for multiple language sets on the web pages and stream directory,
      however many source clients for MP3 type streams have assumed Latin1
      (ISO-8859-1) or leave it to whatever character set is in use on the source
      client system.

      This character mismatch has been known to cause a problem as the stats
      engine and stream directory servers want UTF8 so now we assume Latin1 for
      non-Ogg streams (to handle the common case) but you can specify an
      alternative character set with this option.

      This specifies that the named mount point will require listener
      authentication using HTTP basic auth. Despite the official documentation
      claiming to only support "htpasswd" type authentication, it also supports
      "url" type authentication and even provides examples elsewhere in their
      documentation.. They really need to go through and clean up everything...

      Anyway here is an example of htpasswd type authentication...

      The htpasswd authenticator requires a few parameters. The first, filename,
      specifies the name of the file to use to store users and passwords. Note
      that this file need not exist (and probably will not exist when you first
      set it up). Icecast has built-in support for managing users and passwords
      via the web admin interface. The second option, allow_duplicate_users, if
      set to 0, will prevent multiple connections using the same username.
      Setting this value to 1 will enable mutltiple connections from the same
      username on a given mountpoint. Note there is no way to specify a "max
      connections" for a particular user.
    -->
    <authentication type="htpasswd">
      <option name="filename" value="users-auth-file" />
      <option name="allow_duplicate_users" value="0" />
    </authentication>

    <!--
      And an example for URL authentication...

      Authenticating listeners via the URL method involves icecast, when a
      listener connects, issuing requests to a web server and checking the
      response headers. If a certain header is sent back then the listener
      connecting is allowed to continue, if not, an error is sent back to the
      listener.

      The URLs specified will invoke some web server scripts like PHP to do any
      work that they may choose to do. All that is required of the scripting
      language is that POST information can be handled and response headers can
      be sent back. libcurl is used for the requesting so https connections may
      be possible, but be aware of the extra overhead involved.

      The useragent sent in each curl request will represent the icecast server
      version. The response headers will depend on whether the listener is to be
      accepted. Acceptance is determined by the auth_header option you can also
      passed a failed reason in a header that looks like the following:

        icecast-auth-message: some reason for failure

      Each of the options described below are optional. Each option sends the
      parameters action, mount, server, and port. The action is the name of the
      option, the server is either the hostname or IP the user is connected to
      (haven't tested this), the port is the port the user is connected on and
      the mount is the stream mount point with leading slash that the user is
      attempting to connect to. The last catch is that listener_add and
      listener_remove have additional parameters, which are documented in their
      sections..

      The documentation mentions that these will be sent as a POST request,
      however, the way they are shown look like they are actually a GET
      request...
    -->
    <authentication type="url">
      <!--
        This URL is for informing the auth server of a stream starting. No
        listener information is passed for this, but can be used to initialise

        This is most likely to be used if anything. When a listener connects,
        before anything is sent back to them, this request is processed. The
        default action is to reject a listener unless the auth server sends back
        a response header which may be stated in the 'header' option.

        listener_add also provides, client, user, pass, ip, and agent. client is
        a unique number for the client that is connected. I don't know if the
        client number is re-used after a client disconnects, I don't know if this
        count gets reset every time a source connect or only when the server
        restarts or if it ever resets at all. I suspect user is filled in with
        the value of any basic auth user that has been sent, same with password
        but this might also get filled in by the the 'username' and 'password'
        options that are undocumented, ip is the IP address of the client and
        agent is the user agent the client provided. This is quite a bit of

        pass are the same as for listener_add in that I assume it's the clients
        basic auth but it could also be the username and password fields passed
