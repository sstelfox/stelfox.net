Useful for monitoring system statistics such as CPU core temperatures. After
installing the `lm_sensors` packages you can run the `sensors-detect` command
that will walk you through loading any kernel modules that may be necessary to
read sensor data. Executing the `sensors` command will output the results of
all of that nice information :)
