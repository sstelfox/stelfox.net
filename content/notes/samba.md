FEAR FOR THOSE WHO TREAD THESE WATERS FOR THEY ARE DEEP AND EVIL.

## SELinux Adjustments

SELinux hates Samba and with good reason. To allow authenticated clients to
access the contents of a samba share you need to label the share. The easiest
way to make this persistent is by adjusting the targeted SELinux config. In the
following example the only samba share is location at /media/sharing.

Add this to `/etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/file_contexts`:

```
/media/storage(/.*)?    system_u:object_r:samba_share_t:s0
```

Then run this command:

```
[root@localhost ~]# restorecon -R /media/storage
```

## On Anonymous Access

If you intend to allow anonymous browsing of shares and/or access to a share,
you will need to create a 'nobody' user with no password and add a few lines to
the configuration file. Add the user by following the instructions in 'Managing
Users'

## Managing Users

To add a samba user make sure they have an account on the local machine, and
run the command:

```
[root@localhost ~]# pdbedit -a <username>
```

To list samba users:

```
[root@localhost ~]# pdbedit -L
```

To delete a samba user:

```
[root@localhost ~]# pdbedit -x <username>
```
