## Red Hat Based Systems

### Simple Static IP Address

You'll need to find the interface name of your primary ethernet card. Generally
this can be done with the `ipaddr show` command. The device name will more
likely than not be either `eth0` or `em1`, though occasionally I've seen
ethernet addresses along the lines of `p12p1` (which is a terrible naming
convention that bothers the hell out of me but I understand why the linux
developers switched to this naming convention).

This is going to assume that you want to set a static address on `eth0`, it's
going to be the primary interface (in that it will have the default gateway).
You'll want to edit the file `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0` in
this case. Make sure that the device name at the end of the file AND the one in
the config match.

You'll also need to make sure the mac address of the card matches the `HWADDR`
in the file otherwise the network script will throw a fit and will either fail
to bring up the interface or just complain and use the real hardware address
anyway. You can not use this script to "spoof" mac addresses.

The contents of the following file set the static IP address `10.13.37.200` on
the interface with `10.13.37.1` as the default gateway, and two nameservers
`8.8.8.8` and `4.2.2.2`.

This also tells the network that we're on a `/24` network the interface should
start up when the machine does and that if this fails to come up the rest of
the boot scripts that rely on a network should be skipped (That's the
`IPV4_FAILURE_FATAL` command).

```
# /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
DEVICE="eth0"
NM_CONTROLLED="yes"
ONBOOT="yes"
HWADDR="12:34:56:78:90:AB"
BOOTPROTO="static"

IPADDR="10.13.37.200"
NETMASK="255.255.255.0"
GATEWAY="10.13.37.1"

DNS1="8.8.8.8"
DNS2="4.2.2.2"
DOMAIN="internal.example.org"

DEFROUTE="yes"

IPV4_FAILURE_FATAL="yes"
IPV6INIT="yes"

NAME="Standard LAN"
```

You'll need to restart the NetworkManager for this to take effect like so:

```
systemctl restart NetworkManager.service
```

### Additional IP Addresses

Additional IP addresses are one of the simplest things to perform. In the
following example I'm going to be created an additional IP on the eth0
interface assuming we're using the same eth0 described in the last section.

Too add an IP address to the eth0 interface we simply create a new one by
copying that file into a new one and adding a `:1` to the name additional
addresses would need to increment this number. So like so:

```
cp /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0:1
```

You'll need to open up the new file and change a few things. Specifically you
want to get rid of the "HWADDR" variable, change the IP to whatever the second
IP will be and change the device name to reflect the `:1`. The new file will
look like this:

```
# /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0:1
DEVICE="eth0:1"
NM_CONTROLLED="no"
ONBOOT="yes"
BOOTPROTO="static"

IPADDR="10.13.37.201"
NETMASK="255.255.255.0"
DEFROUTE="no"

IPV4_FAILURE_FATAL="yes"
IPV6INIT="yes"

NAME="Standard LAN"
```

Bring it up like so:

```
ifup eth0:1
```

Bam. Done.

```
[root@localhost ~]# ifconfig eth0:1
eth0:1    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 12:34:56:78:90:AB  
          inet addr:10.13.37.201  Bcast:10.13.37.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
```

### Routing

This section describes how to turn a linux system into a basic router. This
assumes that the user is competent enough to know a few things about routing
already including what needs to be routed.

Note: I noticed that my port forwarding issue seemed to go away after
installing the iptstate package. This may be because it installed
`libnetfilter_conntrack` as a dependency. Based on the `yum info` description I
don't believe this to be the case. Further testing may be required.

#### Configuration

##### /etc/sysctl.conf

The following settings need to be changed/added to securely handle the routing.
Detailed information about the individual options is [available][1] as well as
[Routing RFC information][2].

```
# Controls IP packet forwarding
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1

# Enable dynamic-ip address hacking for use with a DHCP WAN address and Masquerading
net.ipv4.ip_dynaddr = 1

# Ignore ICMP broadcast packets
net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1

# Log spoofed packets, source routed packets, redirect packets
net.ipv4.conf.default.log_martians = 1

# Do not accept source routing
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0

# Controls source route verification, this would drop all packets going out a different interface
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 0

# Since we're only going to have one route going out (the WAN interface, we have no need to adjust our routing table
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects = 0

# Decrease the time default value for tcp_fin_timeout connection
net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 15

# Decrease the time default value for tcp_keepalive_time connection
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time = 1800
```

Active One:

The only thing that changes in this among the five interfaces are the IP
address options, the comment at the top and the name at the bottom. All of that
information is documented elsewhere on this wiki.
