# Data Recovery

## Recovering Data from Swap

Sometimes useful bits of information can be recovered from swap. Whether it's encryption keys, documents that were being worked on or anything else that might've ended up in RAM. To search through the swap for interesting bits (and depending on the size this might take a while) you can execute the following command as root or sudo to do it:

```console
# strings `/bin/swapon -s | tail -1 | awk '{print $1}'` | less
```

The command above uses the swapon utility to list all of the swap devices in use; look at the last line of the output (most people only have one swap device); extract only the path to the device node. Run the strings utility (which prints only printable strings of text from whatever you run through it) on the swap device. Break the output down by pages.

A lot of the output will look like junk, but if you're patient some interesting things can pop out at you.
