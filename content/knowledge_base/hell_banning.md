A hellbanned user is invisible to all other users, but crucially, not himself.
From their perspective, they are participating normally in the community but
nobody ever responds to them.

They can no longer disrupt the community because they are effectively
invisible. It's a clever way of enforcing the "don't feed the troll" rule in
the community. When nothing they post ever gets a response, a hellbanned user
is likely to get bored or frustrated and leave.
