## Computer Security

Physical security is the first step to hardening a server. In most cases if an
attacker gains physical access to a device they own it. This section of the
wiki provides a few basic things to consider when placing and setting up a
server.

### Protecting the Machine

The most basic tenant of physical protection is don't let unauthorized people
near the machine. Once an attacker has physical access to a machine you can put
road-blocks in place to slow them down but if they are determined and
intelligent they will get access to the machine. Make sure servers are in a
locked room with limited access.

### Surge Protector / UPS

Every computer should be on a minimum of a surge protector. UPS's in addition
to being able to allow a machine to properly shut down when the power goes out
tend to provide cleaner power than a simple surge protector. It is highly
recommend to use a UPS if it's available.

### The Machine's Environment

This is not something that can always be done, but providing a machine a
comfortable ideal atmosphere to work in will prolong the life of it's
components and ensure it's uptime. An ideal location for a server will have a
temperature between 60 and 80 degrees fahrenheit and a relative humidity
between 30% and 60%. Adding in environmental sensors can alert and
administrator before their system's cook due to AC failures and is strongly
recommended.
