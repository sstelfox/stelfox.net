# Home

This is the digital home of Sam Stelfox, a staff software engineer with a focus on security, data analytics, and backend processing. I keep my [thoughts](blog) on various things as they come up in my blog posts as well as [publish notes](notes) on tasks, service configuration, systems, and hobbies.

I've also written a little bit [about myself](about) if you'd like to learn more about me.
