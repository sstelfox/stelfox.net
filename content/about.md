Thank you for taken an interest in me. Professionally I'm a systems programmer
with over a decade of experience of architecting, configuring, maintaining, and
operating both local and cloud services. I've been a network and systems
administrator (Windows & Linux), web developer, security analyst, cloud
architect, devops throughout some portion of my career.

Currently I'm working at [Minim][1] bringing some of my security knowledge to
improving the state of home and IoT security.

Personally, I'm an eternal student and explorer of the universe. I read as much
as my free time allows, from the most dry of the current batch of whitepapers,
to philosophy through history, to various types of fiction (with historical
fiction and hard scifi having special places in my heart and collection).

I love teaching and helping people. This has driven me to volunteer at several
security conferences, found a [hackerspace][2] with friends, and help setup and
run maker faires.

I work on software in some of my free time, usually trying to learn something
new or recreating a service that I use regularly (either because it has a flaw
that is annoying me, or to better understand the problem space). There are few
things I enjoy as much as holding another world in my hands, washed in the
smell of the tannins mingling with a good cup of coffee in the morning.

For a more detailed professional breakdown, I encourage you to peruse my
[LinkedIn][3] profile. If you'd like to get a hold of me to ask about a
project, myself, or just want a friend you can reach me by:

* send me a message [via email][4] (Probably the best choice)
* ping me on [Github][5]
* or reach out to me on [Twitter][6]

I'd kindly like recruiters, and those looking to sell me goods or services to
refrain from reaching out. I exclusively use personal referrals or my own
research for products and services and do not appreciate the spam.
