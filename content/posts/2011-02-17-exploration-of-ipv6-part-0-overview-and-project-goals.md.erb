title: 'Exploration of IPv6 Part 0: Overview and Project Goals'
---

Last week I finally picked up a project that I've been putting off for far too
long. IPv6. With all of the Class A IPv4 subnets assigned and the total pool of
available addresses rapidly dwindling it was time to make the move. When I
started hunting down information about IPv6 and using it on my local network I
was inundated with a lot of information about _what_ IPv6 is, _why_ we need it,
and _when_ everyone will need to be on it but very little about how to
implement it.

To this end I'm writing these posts about the how and glossing over the what,
why, and when. For those of you who are interested in that information I
strongly recommend you read the [Wikipedia article on
IPv6][1]. It covers everything that I've found
in other blog posts and news releases and a lot more that isn't.

On to the specifics. My home network is closer to a small-business network
crossed with an enterprise network. I have multiple subnets devoted to specific
tasks (Public, DMZ, Server, Trusted LAN). I have two wireless networks, the
first one is WPA2 802.1x using my own  PKI for certificates, and the second is
WEP  secured with static addresses MAC restrictions and does not route to the
internet. The latter is for some very old devices I have that don't support the
secure wireless but still need to talk to a local service.

Ultimately I should not have to sacrifice any of my security to upgrade to IPv6
and I firmly believe in defence in depth. Off the top of my head the only thing
I lose security wise is NAT which a lot of people argue is security through
obscurity and not actually a layer of security but I [personally disagree][2].
I don't _have_ to lose NAT as there are NAT66 options out there but to be
honest, we need to start looking at the future and sticking with old and
outdated security models will only end up causing a lot of trouble. I also
don't want to deal with the thought of 2^16,386 potential addresses out there
(That's assuming every IPv6 address is hiding a NAT *shudder*).

My servers are all running either Fedora 14 or CentOS 5.5 as I'm most
comfortable with the Red Hat architecture. Anyone out there using a different
system architecture will have to look elsewhere (sorry). I also have Mac OS X
(10.3 and 10.4) and Windows 7 clients. Lucky for me they all support IPv6
natively, they just need to be configured.

So what do I want to accomplish with this project? I intend to break this down
into stages, each stage will be followed up with a post on this blog with the
details of what I did, how I accomplished it, and any pitfalls I ran into.
These stages will be:
	
1. Firewall, Initial Connection, and Security Plan
2. Getting the clients online (Routing, FreeRADIUS, radvd)
3. Getting the public servers online (Apache, Postfix, Bind)
4. Getting file & database servers online (MySQL, OpenLDAP, Samba, NFSv4)
5. Getting support services online (Kerberos, Syslog, Snort)
6. Pulling the plug on IPv4 (NAT64, DNS64)
7. One month IPv6 only report

Part 2 may also include ISC DHCPd configuration for stateful IPv6 client
configuration. This will be something that I cover all the pros and cons about
in the security plan and will be decided then. At the very end (Parts 6 & 7) I
will have all of my home systems running IPv6 only for one month too see the
state of IPv6 and see what clients still work. Thanks to the magic of NAT64 and
DNS64 I should be able to access everything that is still IPv4 as if it was
IPv6.

Stay tuned. This is going to be a bumpy ride.
