title: 'IPv6 Enabled WebServers'
---

I've happily been using [DreamHost][1] (Promo code: SKETCHYFRIENDS for a
discount if you'd like) for over 6 years now.  They [recently announced][2]
that they are IPv6 enabled. All of my webservers are happily on the IPv6
internet now thanks to them and it was free to boot. In my upcoming IPv6 trials
I now know at the very least I will still be able to update this blog.

Thanks DreamHost for staying on top of technology like this! You never
disappoint.
