This evening [Gabe Koss][1] and myself gave a lightning talk on [Riak][2] at
the [Burlington Web Applications Group][3]. Due too time constraints there was
a lot of material that we simply weren't able to cover, but with any luck I'll
be covering in future blog posts.

There was a great turn out as usual, and it was lots of fun. If you're in the
Burlington, VT area and are interested in web applications written in any
language you should show up. You'll learn something and meet a lot of cool
people. You might even get a book out of the deal.

You can [take a look at the slides][4] if you missed the talk.
