The BIOS was quite a bit more complicated and there was a few options that I
had available to try, all of which require either Windows or DOS environments.
I don't have any legal copies of Windows to put on my server and didn't want to
go through all that effort`

It really needs to be done within a DOS environment. I downloaded the file
`PEC6100BIOS017000.exe` from [Dell's support
website](http://downloads.dell.com/Pages/Drivers/poweredge-c6100-all.html)
([locally hosted copy](http://static.stelfox.net/files/PEC6100BIOS017000.exe))
as well as the [2.88Mb version of
FreeDOS](http://www.fdos.org/bootdisks/autogen/FDSTD.288.imz) ([locally hosted
copy](http://static.stelfox.net/files/FDSTD.288.imz)).
