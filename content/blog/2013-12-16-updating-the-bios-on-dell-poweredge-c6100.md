# Updating the BIOS on Dell PowerEdge C6100

The BIOS was quite a bit more complicated and there was a few options that I had available to try, all of which require either Windows or DOS environments. I don't have any legal copies of Windows to put on my server and didn't want to go through all that effort`

It really needs to be done within a DOS environment. I downloaded the file "PEC6100BIOS017000.exe" from Dell's support website ([locally hosted copy](http://static.stelfox.net/files/PEC6100BIOS017000.exe)) as well as the [2.88Mb version of FreeDOS](http://www.fdos.org/bootdisks/autogen/FDSTD.288.imz) ([locally hosted copy](http://static.stelfox.net/files/FDSTD.288.imz)).
