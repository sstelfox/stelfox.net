I [recently posted]({{< relref "2013-11-19-backing-up-gmail-with-fetchmail.md"
>}}) a guide on backing up your Gmail with fetchmail. This unfortunately
doesn't include your calendar data. It seems like backing up was a hot enough
topic that the Google Gmail team are [releasing an official backup
method](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2013/12/download-copy-of-your-gmail-and-google.html).
It's not completely in the wild yet but I definitely look forward to poking
around in it.

Now if only Google let you download everything they know about you as well...
Would definitely make for an interesting read.
