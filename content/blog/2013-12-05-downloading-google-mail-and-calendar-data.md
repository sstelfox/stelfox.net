title: Downloading Google Mail and Calendar Data
---

I [recently posted][1] a guide on backing up your Gmail with `fetchmail`. This
unfortunately doesn't include your calendar data. It seems like backing up was
a hot enough topic that the Google Gmail team are [releasing an official backup
method][2].  It's not completely in the wild yet but I definitely look forward
to poking around in it.

Now if only Google let you download everything they know about you as well...
Would definitely make for an interesting read.
