# Downloading Google Mail and Calendar Data

I [recently posted]({{< ref "./2013-11-19-backing-up-gmail-with-fetchmail.md" >}}) a guide on backing up your Gmail with "fetchmail". This unfortunately doesn't include your calendar data. It seems like backing up was a hot enough topic that the Google Gmail team are [releasing an official backup method](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2013/12/download-copy-of-your-gmail-and-google.html). It's not completely in the wild yet but I definitely look forward to poking around in it.

Now if only Google let you download everything they know about you as well... Would definitely make for an interesting read.
