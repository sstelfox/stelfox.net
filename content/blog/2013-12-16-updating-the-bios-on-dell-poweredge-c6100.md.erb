The BIOS was quite a bit more complicated and there was a few options that I
had available to try, all of which require either Windows or DOS environments.
I don't have any legal copies of Windows to put on my server and didn't want to
go through all that effort`

It really needs to be done within a DOS environment. I downloaded the file
`PEC6100BIOS017000.exe` from [Dell's support website][1] ([locally hosted
copy][2]) as well as the [2.88Mb version of FreeDOS][3] ([locally hosted
copy][4]).
