title: 'IPv6 Enabled WebServers'
---

I've happily been using [DreamHost][1] for over 6 years now. They [recently
announced][2] that they are IPv6 enabled. All of my webservers are happily on
the IPv6 internet now thanks to them and it was free to boot. In my upcoming
IPv6 trials I now know at the very least I will still be able to update this
blog.

Thanks DreamHost for staying on top of technology like this! You never
disappoint.
