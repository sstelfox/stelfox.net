I've happily been using
[DreamHost](http://www.dreamhost.com/redir.cgi?ad=rewards%7C71008) for over 6
years now. They [recently
announced](http://blog.dreamhost.com/2011/02/03/ipv6-now-available-from-dreamhost/)
that they are IPv6 enabled. All of my webservers are happily on the IPv6
internet now thanks to them and it was free to boot. In my upcoming IPv6 trials
I now know at the very least I will still be able to update this blog.

Thanks DreamHost for staying on top of technology like this! You never
disappoint.
