Following up on my [earlier post][1] where I covered how to backup your Gmail
account using `fetchmail` and `procmail`; I wanted to cover how I was
additionally processing received mail through ruby.

This was part of a larger project where I was doing statistical analysis on my
email while evaluating various data stores. To get the emails into the various
data stores, I used the ruby script to parse, process and store the emails as
they came in.

If you're going to be doing any form of mail manipulation or statistics I
highly recommend the [mail][2] gem. It did almost everything I needed out of
the box, though it didn't correctly enumerate any of the additional headers.

Procmail is a highly flexible mail filtering and local delivery agent. Without
much effort you can pass the mail it is handling through a series of filters
which can manipulate and reject mail before eventually delivering it to your
inbox. In light of this, we're going to make a filter that simply counts the
total number of emails the script has processed, and add a header to the
message that indicates this count.

```ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'mail'

# Get the email message from STDIN / Passed filename
message = ""
while input = ARGF.gets
  message += input
end

msg = Mail.new(message)

count_file = "#{ENV['HOME']}/mail_counter.txt"

count = File.exists?(count_file) ? File.read(count_file).to_i : 0
count += 1

File.write(count_file, count.to_s)

# Put the (presumably manipulated) message back out to $stdout
begin
  $stdout.puts message
rescue Errno::EPIPE
  exit(74)
end
```
