<h2 id="bcm4311">BCM4311</h2>
<p>There is a known issue with Fedora 15+ and BCM4311 wireless cards where the
wireless will connect, stay connected for a few minutes, then disconnect until
either the machine is rebooted or wpa_supplicant and NetworkManager are
rebooted. The latter does not always solve the problem. I&rsquo;ve personally
observed this issue being more prominent when large file transfers are taking
place.</p>
<p>Before taking these steps you should verify that you do indeed have a Broadcom
BCM4311 wireless card. This can be done with the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#c9d1d9;background-color:#0d1117;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>lspci | grep -i bcm4311
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You should see something along the following if you have the card:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#c9d1d9;background-color:#0d1117;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>0c:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4311 802.11b/g WLAN (rev 01)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Ensure you have a wired connection as you will lose access to the wireless card
during this process. You have been warned :). Please also note that the
following commands (with the exception of the reboots) won&rsquo;t do anything unless
you have the RPMFusion repository installed.</p>
<p>As root install the akmod-wl package and reboot like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#c9d1d9;background-color:#0d1117;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>yum install akmod-wl -y
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>reboot
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Once the system has finished rebooting, perform a system update which will grab
a few additional packages, and reboot once again:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#c9d1d9;background-color:#0d1117;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>yum update -y
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>reboot
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If you are unable to see the wireless card then this solution probably hasn&rsquo;t
worked for you. You can bring the card back online by running the following as
root:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#c9d1d9;background-color:#0d1117;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>modprobe b43
</span></span></code></pre></div>
