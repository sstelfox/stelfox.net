<p><strong><em>Note: This page is quite old and is likely out of date. My opinions may have
also changed dramatically since this was written. It is here as a reference
until I get around to updating it.</em></strong></p>

<p>Squid Guard is officially a &ldquo;URL Rewrite Program&rdquo;. It takes information about
the requested page coming in and checks it against a series of ACLs,
blacklists, and whitelists in an order specified by the administrator. The
administrator can redirect offending pages to a block page (which has to be a
hosted site outside of squid).</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>Don&rsquo;t use the &ldquo;squidGuard&rdquo; service, it is incorrectly defined, looking
for non-existant files, and is poorly implemented. Call squidGuard directly
from the squid config (see <a href="/notes/squid/" target="_blank">Squid</a>).</p>

<p>NOTICE: To use squid guard at all you need to have a web server setup to
redirect sites that are denied. For this purpose I decided to install apache,
create a folder &ldquo;guard&rdquo; and within it a file named blocked.php that simply
prints out the contents of the $_GET variable. With the config provided this
will show the client&rsquo;s address, name, username, group, category of the
offending URL and the URL itself. This can be used to properly display an error
message. I am quite annoyed by how this works&hellip; I&rsquo;d much prefer to just deny
the requests&hellip;</p>

<pre><code>yum install squidGuard -y
</code></pre>

<h3 id="black-white-lists">Black &amp; White Lists</h3>

<p>Remove the default blacklist file as we&rsquo;re going to use another one. This is a
necessary step to continue using the rest of these instructions. If you don&rsquo;t
wan to use the Shalla Lists, you&rsquo;ll have to adapt to the instructions given
however they shouldn&rsquo;t differ much between different lists.</p>

<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# rm -f /var/squidGuard/blacklists.tar.gz
[root@localhost ~]# mkdir -p /var/squidGuard/blacklists
[root@localhost ~]# mkdir -p /var/squidGuard/whitelists/custom/
[root@localhost ~]# touch /var/squidGuard/whitelists/custom/domains
[root@localhost ~]# touch /var/squidGuard/whitelists/custom/urls
</code></pre>

<p>Download a blacklist file, <a href="http://www.shallalist.de/" target="_blank">Shalla List</a> seems to be the defacto/good one.</p>

<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# curl http://www.shallalist.de/Downloads/shallalist.tar.gz -o /var/squidGuard/blacklists/shallalist.tar.gz 2&gt;/dev/null
[root@localhost ~]# curl http://www.shallalist.de/Downloads/shallalist.tar.gz.md5 -o /var/squidGuard/blacklists/shallalist.tar.gz.md5 2&gt; /dev/null
[root@localhost ~]# cat /var/squidGuard/blacklists/shallalist.tar.gz.md5 &amp;&amp; md5sum /var/squidGuard/blacklists/shallalist.tar.gz
c50fdc59593bc3e5c5863e2b120f6fed  shallalist.tar.gz
c50fdc59593bc3e5c5863e2b120f6fed  /var/squidGuard/blacklists/shallalist.tar.gz
</code></pre>

<p>Note: the md5sums are the same (we received an intact download, the sums will
be different everytime it updates).</p>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve verified the blacklists lets extract them.</p>

<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# cd /var/squidGuard
[root@localhost squidGuard]# tar -xzvf shallalist.tar.gz --strip-components 1
[root@localhost squidGuard]# chown -R squid:squid /var/squidGuard/
</code></pre>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

<p>By default, squidGuard tries to store it&rsquo;s logfiles in <code>/var/log/squidGuard</code>,
however, since squid starts up squidGuard, squidGuard will be running under the
squid user. This is important as the squid user won&rsquo;t have permission to
<code>/var/log/squidGuard</code>. We should switch it too <code>/var/log/squid</code>, and ensure
that <code>/var/squidGuard/blacklists</code> are owned by squid with the squid group.</p>

<pre><code># Configure locations for the rest of squidGuard's files

logdir /var/log/squid

<h2 id="live-config-changes">Live Config Changes</h2>

<p>The squid command &ldquo;squid -k reconfigure&rdquo; DOES re-evaluate squidGuard config
changes as well. This make it very easy to quickly adjust things all over the
server without a significant service interruption.</p>

<h2 id="testing-and-diagnostics">Testing and Diagnostics</h2>

<p>So what I&rsquo;ve found in my experimentation is that if there is an issue with
squidGuard starting up squid will still success and there will probably not be
any errors anywhere, it will simply not block anything. This is obviously not
an ideal situation. To test and make sure that your configuration is good (or
possibly see the errors that may be preventing the filtering from working) run
the following command:</p>

<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# squidGuard -c /etc/squid/squidGuard.conf -C all
</code></pre>

<p>It will go through and build the database files for every category defined in
the configuration then verify that everything is in order. If an error does
occur you&rsquo;ll see the message:</p>

<pre><code>2011-09-20 12:15:50 [7140] Going into emergency mode
</code></pre>

<p>Look on the line above it and it you&rsquo;ll have to figure out the issue based on
that message.</p>

<p>NOTE: After performing this command all of the database files will be owned by
root! This won&rsquo;t work, fix the issue running the following command:</p>

<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# chown -R squid:squid /var/squidGuard/*
</code></pre>

<p>Additional permission issues can (usually) be resolved with the following
commands:</p>

<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# chown -R root:squid /etc/squid
[root@localhost ~]# chmod 640 /etc/squid/*
</code></pre>

<p>To test individual rules to make sure things are being redirected or blocked
correctly you can test squidGuard with something along the following lines:</p>

<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# su squid -s /bin/bash -
bash-4.2$ echo &quot;http://porn.com 10.0.0.1/ - - GET&quot; | squidGuard -d -c /etc/squid/squidGuard.conf
</code></pre>

<p>It will either return nothing (passes the check) or return a URL to redirect
the user too (failed the check). You can replace the 10.0.0.1 with an IP of a
machine you&rsquo;d like to test the rules with.</p>

<h2 id="security-notes">Security Notes</h2>

<p>squidGuard is an additional layer of protection against known bad sites. It can
not possibly catch all of the bad sites but it does help. For any general
browsing that you don&rsquo;t want to restrict the content of, I strongly suggest
including the following groups as exclusions. They will help promote anonymous
safe browsing.</p>

<ul>
<li>adv</li>
<li>costtraps</li>
<li>in-addr</li>
<li>redirector</li>
<li>ringtones</li>
<li>spyware</li>
<li>trackers</li>
</ul>

<p>The only one that may cause issues is the &ldquo;in-addr&rdquo; one which blocks going to
IP addresses directly. I personally get around this by including the sites I
want to access directly in my whitelist file.</p>

            &lt;p&gt;This could have happened because it is currently business hours and you are trying to get too a site that is in our business hours blacklist, it could have been blocked for safety reasons (for example the site is known to host malware or attempt to phish information from unsuspecting users), or it could be a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If this is a mistake and you feel that this site should be removed from the blacklist, please email the administrator with the information provided below. Please note how urgent the access is required as it can take up to 48 hours for a request to be processed.
