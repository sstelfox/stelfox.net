  <h1>AIDE</h1><div class="post-content"><p>AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) is a file and directory
integrity checker that compares the current hashes, permissions, and attributes
of files directories against a known database built from the system.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>This can be run periodically to detect manipulation of critical system files,
though a motivated attacker with an appropriate level of permissions could
modify this database or disable the check as long as the system is able to
write to it.</p>
<p>For this to be effective this process needs to be added to the systems update
process and the database should be backed up immediately after being updated.
With good backups in place this can help identify what changes were made by an
attacker after a breach which can be invaluable in knowing both the impact and
intent of a security incident.</p>
<h2 id="important-caveat">Important Caveat</h2>
<p>There does seems to be an issue that causes core dumps like so:</p>
<pre><code>Floating point exception (core dumped)
</code></pre>
<p>I initially suspected UTF-8 characters in the path name or to many files. Both
I was able to disprove. I can enable all checks on an effected directory except
for any of the hashes (I tested all the ones available to me individually).</p>
<p>The issue itself could be with the specific compiled version (community/aide
0.16-1 on arch linux) I was testing with.</p>
<p>After <code>strace</code>'ing down the files it was having issues with I simply excluded
the files that were triggering the issue from checksum validation. I couldn't
find anything unusual about the files themselves though... No extended
attributes, normal permissions, readable... Maybe a bug in <code>libmhash</code>?</p>
<h2 id="secure-usage">Secure Usage</h2>
<p>While this utility provides no preventative defense measures, it is extremely
useful in the detection of malicious behavior on the host. To perform this
detection, a cron job should periodically have AIDE analyze the files it is
monitoring and report the findings. A central logging system should be setup to
consume these reports.</p>
<p>For these reports to be effective, the reference database needs to be trusted
and well maintained. To accomplish this I recommend hosting a read-only NFS
volume mounted at a known location to store the current database.</p>
<p>This database will likely need to be updated after every system update as
critical binaries and configuration files may have been updated. If an
automation system like <a href="https://stelfox.net/notes/puppet/">puppet</a> is in use, automatic modification of
configuration files or installed packages may also trigger this.</p>
<h2 id="initial-setup">Initial Setup</h2>
<p>The defaults are reasonably sane so you can continue with the default
configuration that ships with several distributions, but there are several
things it will miss. Arch Linux's default doesn't catch:</p>
<ul>
<li>SELinux and extended attributes (though SELinux doesn't apply)</li>
<li>Permissions and security hearings under /dev</li>
<li>Any of the content or security attributes for most files under /etc</li>
<li>/lib64 (though if it's a symlink it's likely covered)</li>
<li>/srv (though it's not commonly used)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have one <a href="https://stelfox.net/notes/aide/aide.conf">that avoids</a> these issues. I recommend reviewing it,
understanding it, and adjusting it for your environment before installing it to
<code>/etc/aide/aide.conf</code>. Be sure to restrict access to the file appropriately:</p>
<pre><code>chmod 0600 /etc/aide/aide.conf
chown root:root /etc/aide/aide.conf
</code></pre>
<p>You need to initialize the database as a baseline for the system, which can be
done with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>aide --init
</code></pre>
<p>Depending on the amount of packages installed on your system and the speed of
your disks this can take quite some time (on a fairly minimal production system
for me this took about two minutes). You then need to copy the created database
into the reference location (these locations are dependent on <a href="https://stelfox.net/notes/aide/aide.conf">my
configuration</a>):</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p /var/lib/aide/reference
cp /var/lib/aide/aide-$(hostname -f).db.new.gz /var/lib/aide/reference/aide-$(hostname -f).db.gz
</code></pre>
<p>You can confirm the system is working with:</p>
<pre><code>aide --check
</code></pre>
<p>If any monitored file or directory's attributes changed they will be reported
to both STDOUT and written to <code>/var/log/aide/aide.log</code>. This file is always
completely rewritten after every run, if you want to keep historical reports,
<a href="https://stelfox.net/notes/logrotate/">logrotate</a> can be used to move these files aside.</p>
<p>I do recommend reviewing the configuration file both to ensure all critical
system directories are covered on your systems and to be aware of what is
monitored and to what extent. Pay special attention to the package manager
files of your system as they may not be included in the default configuration.</p>
<p>If you make any changes it is wise to validate the configuration afterwards by
running:</p>
<pre><code>aide --config-check
</code></pre>
<p>It will produce no output and exit with a zero status if the configuration is
valid.</p>
<p>I have a modified configuration file covering my general use case
<a href="https://stelfox.net/notes/aide/aide.conf">available</a>, a slightly tweaked <a href="https://stelfox.net/notes/aide/aide.cron">cron job</a>, and slightly <a href="https://stelfox.net/notes/aide/sshaide.sh">modified
script</a> to check AIDE integrity remotely using SSH (original in the
<code>contrib</code> directory of the AIDE source). If you use any of these you will
likely need to adjust paths to match the configuration.</p>
