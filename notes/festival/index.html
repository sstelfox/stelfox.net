My opinions may have
also changed dramatically since this was written. It is here as a reference
until I get around to updating it.</strong></em></p><p>Festival is packaged in a way on Fedora in a standalone mode, it does not come
with an init script to startup it&rsquo;s server on boot so the following is an
adaptation of another one custom written to handle this. It&rsquo;s primarily used in
Fedora for Gnome&rsquo;s usability support which doesn&rsquo;t run the server as a daemon.</p><p>Listening to the samples of the stock voices, I&rsquo;ve found that <code>ked</code> sounds the
best in my opinion and at least until we here try and make our own diphone
database this is the voice that I&rsquo;m going to use.</p><p>Packages:</p><ul><li>festival</li><li>asterisk-festival</li><li>festvox-ked-diphone</li></ul><p>In Fedora the voices are stored in the directory
<code>/usr/share/festival/lib/voices/*/</code> directories. These are the voice that you
have to choose from when configuring festival. The configuration files live in
<code>/etc/festival/</code>.</p><p>We&rsquo;re only interested in <code>/etc/festival/festival.scm</code> which doesn&rsquo;t exist by
default. The following file has the <code>ked</code> voice set to be the default. I left
the other voice in there commented out in case I wanted to switch back some
other time.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>(defvar server_home &#34;.&#34;)
