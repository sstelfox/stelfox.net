  <h1>Mailman</h1><div class="post-content"><p><a href="https://www.list.org/">GNU Mailman</a> is a computer software application from the GNU project for
managing electronic mailing lists.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>Mailman is coded primarily in Python and currently maintained by Barry Warsaw.
Mailman is free software, distributed under the GNU General Public License.</p>
<p>While I currently don't have a Mailman installation installed in the
BedroomProgrammers.net, I have had to configure it on several occasions so
keeping my config guide handy in my documentation system could help me in the
future.</p>
<h2 id="security-notes">Security Notes</h2>
<p>Mailman in it's lowest form is a mail relay. Improperly configured, this means
that it could be used as a spam relay. This is not something that can be solved
through crafty firewall trickery so care needs to be taken when configuring the
service.</p>
<h2 id="firewall-adjustments">Firewall Adjustments</h2>
<p>Mailman needs to be able to both send and receive mail. These jobs are handled
by the system's MTA, the only two of which I use are <a href="https://stelfox.net/notes/postfix/">Postfix</a> and
<a href="https://stelfox.net/notes/sendmail/">Sendmail</a> depending on the system. If I ever get around to it I'll also get
around to writing a config guide for Exim. Refer to those for proper hardening
and firewalling.</p>
<p>The other half of Mailman is the administrative interfaces. This is done
through a web site hosted on an <a href="https://stelfox.net/notes/apache/">Apache</a> installation. Please refer to that
guide for firewall and configuration on that service.</p>
