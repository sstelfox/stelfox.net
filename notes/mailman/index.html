My opinions may have
also changed dramatically since this was written. It is here as a reference
until I get around to updating it.</strong></em></p><p><a href=http://www.list.org/>GNU Mailman</a> is a computer software application from the GNU project for
managing electronic mailing lists.</p><p>Mailman is coded primarily in Python and currently maintained by Barry Warsaw.
Mailman is free software, distributed under the GNU General Public License.</p><p>While I currently don't have a Mailman installation installed in the
BedroomProgrammers.net, I have had to configure it on several occasions so
keeping my config guide handy in my documentation system could help me in the
future.</p><h2 id=security-notes>Security Notes</h2><p>Mailman in it's lowest form is a mail relay. Improperly configured, this means
that it could be used as a spam relay. This is not something that can be solved
through crafty firewall trickery so care needs to be taken when configuring the
service.</p><h2 id=firewall-adjustments>Firewall Adjustments</h2><p>Mailman needs to be able to both send and receive mail. These jobs are handled
by the system's MTA, the only two of which I use are <a href=https://stelfox.net/notes/postfix/>Postfix</a> and
<a href=https://stelfox.net/notes/sendmail/>Sendmail</a> depending on the system. If I ever get around to it I'll also get
around to writing a config guide for Exim. Refer to those for proper
hardening and firewalling.</p><p>The other half of Mailman is the administrative interfaces. This is done
through a web site hosted on an <a href=https://stelfox.net/notes/httpd/>Apache</a> installation. Please refer to that
guide for firewall and configuration on that service.</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-git-commit"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="4"/><line x1="1.05" y1="12" x2="7" y2="12"/><line x1="17.01" y1="12" x2="22.96" y2="12"/></svg><a href=e0ae306a5897bc6892dbaa3e409f62aac8e8d735 target=_blank rel=noopener>e0ae306a</a> @ 2024-07-15</p></div></main></div><footer class=footer></footer></div><script type=text/javascript src=/bundle.min.e89fda0f29b95d33f6f4224dd9e5cf69d84aff3818be2b0d73e731689cc374261b016d17d46f8381962fb4a1577ba3017b1f23509d894f6e66431f988c00889e.js integrity="sha512-6J/aDym5XTP29CJN2eXPadhK/zgYvisNc+cxaJzDdCYbAW0X1G+DgZYvtKFXe6MBex8jUJ2JT25mQx+YjACIng=="></script></body></html>
