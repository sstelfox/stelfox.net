My opinions may have
also changed dramatically since this was written. It is here as a reference
until I get around to updating it.</strong></em></p><h2 id=bcm4311>BCM4311</h2><p>There is a known issue with Fedora 15+ and BCM4311 wireless cards where the
wireless will connect, stay connected for a few minutes, then disconnect until
either the machine is rebooted or wpa_supplicant and NetworkManager are
rebooted. The latter does not always solve the problem. I&rsquo;ve personally
observed this issue being more prominent when large file transfers are taking
place.</p><p>Before taking these steps you should verify that you do indeed have a Broadcom
BCM4311 wireless card. This can be done with the following command:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>lspci | grep -i bcm4311
</code></pre><p>You should see something along the following if you have the card:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>0c:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4311 802.11b/g WLAN (rev 01)
</code></pre><p>Ensure you have a wired connection as you will lose access to the wireless card
during this process. You have been warned :). Please also note that the
following commands (with the exception of the reboots) won&rsquo;t do anything unless
you have the RPMFusion repository installed.</p><p>As root install the akmod-wl package and reboot like so:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>yum install akmod-wl -y
reboot
</code></pre><p>Once the system has finished rebooting, perform a system update which will grab
a few additional packages, and reboot once again:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>yum update -y
reboot
</code></pre><p>If you are unable to see the wireless card then this solution probably hasn&rsquo;t
worked for you. You can bring the card back online by running the following as
root:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>modprobe b43
</code></pre></div></article><hr><div class=post-info></div></main></div><footer class=footer></footer></div><script type=text/javascript src=/bundle.min.85fad2de4f13fec3bcb3b3cb10430cdb44a7b4a9749b32938241a5c6e77718df7624f1002b880521fdc26e24ec1077fda214bf1cb36ee3045510760d09638cae.js integrity="sha512-hfrS3k8T/sO8s7PLEEMM20SntKl0mzKTgkGlxud3GN92JPEAK4gFIf3CbiTsEHf9ohS/HLNu4wRVEHYNCWOMrg=="></script></body></html>
