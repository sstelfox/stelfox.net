      <description>I followed the TAILS setup guide to get a secure offline environment running to perform this generation task. The steps I took are documented in the tails document.
Initial Key Creation For simplicity I wanted to clear out the GnuPG configuration that starts out in place. Makes things a lot nicer later on.
rm -rf ~/.gnupg/*  I pulled in the .gnupg/gpg.conf from my dotfiles by hand.
And begin the key generation process</description>

      <description>This is a weird file&amp;hellip; But while installing gentoo on a disk I started getting a weird error when printing the current partitions on the drive:
Warning: The driver descriptor says the physical block size is 2048 bytes, but Linux says it is 512 bytes.  The only thing I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to find anywhere about this is &amp;ldquo;a low-level device tool (like dd) wrote blocks at the wrong size directly onto the device&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>GRE encapsulates all layer 2 traffic, but does so through an unencrypted tunnel. Sensitive traffic should exclusively go through a lower level encrypted tunnel like IPSec.
Firewall The following iptables need to be enabled to allow the GRE traffic to and from the system. This should be restricted to / from IP addresses as well.
-A INPUT -p 47 -j ACCEPT -A OUTPUT -p 47 -j ACCEPT  Manual Setup I&amp;rsquo;ve seen several setups on the internet that make some&amp;hellip; Odd choices.</description>

I am not a huge fan of having xinetd or perl on my system and this is reliant on both, however, there does not currently seem to be any reasonable open source alternatives that support managing a tape library.</description>

      <description>AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) is a file and directory integrity checker that compares the current hashes, permissions, and attributes of files directories against a known database built from the system.
This can be run periodically to detect manipulation of critical system files, though a motivated attacker with an appropriate level of permissions could modify this database or disable the check as long as the system is able to write to it.</description>

Asterisk is a software implementation of a telephone private branch exchange (PBX) originally created in 1999 by Mark Spencer of Digium. Like any PBX, it allows attached telephones to make calls to one another, and to connect to other telephone services including the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services.</description>

Firewall Adjustments A DNS server isn&amp;rsquo;t very good unless other machines are able to query it. The following allows incoming DNS queries universally.
-A INPUT -p udp -m udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT  If you&amp;rsquo;re running named in a chroot you&amp;rsquo;ll also need to add the following line to rsyslog&amp;rsquo;s configuration file so that the chroot doesn&amp;rsquo;t break named&amp;rsquo;s logging.</description>

      <description>Recovering Data from Swap Sometimes useful bits of information can be recovered from swap. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s encryption keys, documents that were being worked on or anything else that might&amp;rsquo;ve ended up in RAM. To search through the swap for interesting bits (and depending on the size this might take a while) you can execute the following command as root or sudo to do it:
[root@localhost ~]# strings `/bin/swapon -s | tail -1 | awk &#39;{print $1}&#39;` | less  The command above uses the swapon utility to list all of the swap devices in use; look at the last line of the output (most people only have one swap device); extract only the path to the device node.</description>

Duplicity is a command line backup utility that makes use of the rsync libraries to perform incremental backups. It also can use GPG public/private keypairs to handle backing up and restoring files.
I personally want to use public / private key pairs for my backups and contrary with what I do most of the time I share a single public / private key pair for my backups, with a strong pass string on the private key.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve already implemented the SSH keys for authentication and have a password on your key then you&amp;rsquo;ve already achieved multi-factor authentication to a certain degree.
The gatekeeper script is something that I haven&amp;rsquo;t come across on any other systems that other people administer. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s too much trouble for them without much gain. I had the idea for this while watching a James Bond movie.
A Russian systems engineer put riddles on one of his machines that you had to go through in order to access the system, while this alone isn&amp;rsquo;t secure, asking the user random questions after authentication couldn&amp;rsquo;t hurt security.</description>

Security Password Protection If left unchecked a malicious user with console access can add or remove kernel parameters or chain-boot onto another device when booting using grub. You can prevent this by requiring the user to enter a password to modify the run-time configuration of grub on boot.</description>

IP6Tables is the firewall that will directly effect IPv6 traffic. This is sample configuration is restricted to allow normal client activity but has no open ports.
Security Notes While turning off IPv6 is definitely one way to handle blocking IPv6 traffic, if I left ip6tables off or in it&amp;rsquo;s default state and an update re-enabled IPv6 in the networking stack somehow it would be as good as having no firewall against any attacker that noticed.</description>

iptables is the bread and butter linux firewall and the last defence before traffic gets to the applications themselves.
Security Notes Since I strongly believe in the defence in-depth strategy, a very strong hardened firewall both ingress and egress is very important.</description>

Icinga is a serious and awesome port of nagios. It properly modernizes it and gives it all the stuff the nagios developers made into an &amp;ldquo;Enterprise only&amp;rdquo; release just to be tool bags. Unfortunately at this time there aren&amp;rsquo;t any handy Fedora packages, but this should be coming soon with any luck.</description>

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a protocol for synchronizing the clocks of computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks. NTP uses UDP on port 123 as its transport layer. It is designed particularly to resist the effects of variable latency by using a jitter buffer.</description>

RedHat Based Systems Simple Static IP Address You&amp;rsquo;ll need to find the interface name of your primary ethernet card. Generally this can be done with the ipaddr show command. The device name will more likely than not be either eth0 or em1, though occasionally I&amp;rsquo;ve seen ethernet addresses along the lines of p12p1 (which is a terrible naming convention that bothers the hell out of me but I understand why the linux developers switched to this naming convention).</description>

Secure Shell or SSH is a network protocol that allows data to be exchanged using a secure channel between two networked devices. Used primarily on GNU/Linux and Unix based systems to access shell accounts, SSH was designed as a replacement for Telnet and other insecure remote shells, which send information, notably passwords, in plaintext, rendering them susceptible to packet analysis.</description>
