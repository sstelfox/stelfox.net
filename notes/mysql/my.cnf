##### SSL Settings #####

# to use an SSL connection when they are connecting to the server, while granting
# them privileges add "REQUIRE SSL" to the end of the grant statement. "REQUIRE
# X509" will require the user to present a valid certificate (it's unclear whether
# this needs to be signed by a certificate in the server's CA file), "REQUIRE
# ISSUER" and "REQUIRE SUBJECT" specify details required in the provided
# certificate. The last three imply "REQUIRE SSL".

# Define the certificate authority file, it should have been used to sign the
# server's certificate, and will be used to validate client certificates that
# have been presented.

# Amount of data to cache, default is 8Mb, shouldn't ever be more than 80% of

# cause other issues on the server such as competition from the OS, and the
# space must be contiguous which isn't always available. This is only the table
# and data cache, MySQLd may allocate additional memory for buffers and control
# structures. On dedicated MySQL boxes it is recommended that this be between
# 75% and 80%

# Breaks the database into smaller more managable pieces, and if careful can

# of main tablespace growth.
innodb_file_per_table

# 0 = A most one second of transactions are lost in the event of an application
# crash, 1 = ACID compliant and most reliable storage of data, 2 is somewhere in
# between 0 and 1 losing at most 1 second of data only in the case of power
# outage or server failure. 1 is the default. If you're not worried about losing
# transactions for the last second or two a value of 2 can have a dramatic increase
# especially when there are a lot of short write transactions.
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2

# An upper limit on the IO activity performed by InnoDB background tasks.
# Default value is 200 with a minimum value of 100. This parameter should be set
# approximately what the IOPS of the system disk the tables are stored on is
# able to provide (100 for 5.2k & 7.2k drives, 150 for 10k, 200 for 15k and
# 250 for SSDs). It is recommended to 'keep this setting as low as practical, but
# not so low that these background activities fall behind.' Too high and data will
# be removed from the buffer pool too quickly to benefit from the caching.
innodb_io_capacity = 100

# This will prevent too much log switching on write heavy databases (default is

# the log to disk before the transactions commit. On larger databases this should
# be set higher to something like 256Mb, there isn't a large benefit above 512Mb

innodb_log_buffer_size = 8M

# The size of each transaction log (default is 5Mb). The larger the value the
# less checkpoint flush activity is needed in the buffer pool saving disk IO at
# the expense of crash recovery time. Recommended is 1/nth of the
# innodb_buffer_pool_size where N is the value of innodb_log_files_in_group. In
# this file that's 1/2 of 32Mb.
