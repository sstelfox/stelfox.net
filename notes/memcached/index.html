it's running under, what port it should listen on, what IP address it should
bind too and how large it's cache is.</p><p>The default port is 11211 (TCP & UDP), and by default it will bind to
<code>INADDR_ANY</code> (0.0.0.0 and ::). Multiple addresses CAN be specified to bind too
with the <code>-l</code> flag. By default memcached will use 64Mb of memory.</p><p>These options can be set in <code>/etc/sysconfig/memcached</code>. Here is mine which
restricts where it's bound too. For my general use 64Mb of storage is more than
enough (roughly the equivalent of 17.5k pages of plain text and these are
simple key value text pairs).</p><pre tabindex=0><code>PORT=&#34;11211&#34;
