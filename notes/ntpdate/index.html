My opinions may have
also changed dramatically since this was written. It is here as a reference
until I get around to updating it.</strong></em></p><p>There are two different means of client configuration. Fedora has a package
<code>ntpdate</code> that should be installed instead of <a href=https://stelfox.net/notes/ntpd/>ntpd</a>. Whenever it is started
it will synchronize the server&rsquo;s clock to any configured time servers. It
needs to be told about time servers it should be synchronizing to in the
<code>/etc/ntp/step-tickers</code>. It then needs to be turned on using the following
command:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>[root@localhost ~]# chkconfig --level 345 ntpdate on
</code></pre><p>If the server doesn&rsquo;t have the ntpdate service (ntpdate seems like it&rsquo;s being
deprecated though I can&rsquo;t imagine why) than the same thing can be accomplished
by installing <a href=https://stelfox.net/notes/ntpd/>ntpd</a> and adding a cron job to synchronize the time.</p><p>The following command will add a cron entry that will get run hourly and
synchronize the time against the time server configured for the ntp daemon
(You&rsquo;ll want to reference <a href=https://stelfox.net/notes/ntpd/>ntpd</a> for that configuration.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>echo &#39;0 * * * * root /usr/sbin/ntpd -q -u ntp:ntp&#39; &gt; /etc/cron.d/ntpd
</code></pre><h2 id=etcntpstep-tickers>/etc/ntp/step-tickers</h2><p>By default this file is empty and ntpdate will have no servers to get it&rsquo;s time
from. This file should include one server per line that are either a FQDN or an
IP address. If there is one or more local time servers they should be the only
ones listed. If there aren&rsquo;t then use the following for the config file:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>0.pool.ntp.org
1.pool.ntp.org
</code></pre></div></article><hr><div class=post-info></div></main></div><footer class=footer></footer></div><script type=text/javascript src=/bundle.min.85fad2de4f13fec3bcb3b3cb10430cdb44a7b4a9749b32938241a5c6e77718df7624f1002b880521fdc26e24ec1077fda214bf1cb36ee3045510760d09638cae.js integrity="sha512-hfrS3k8T/sO8s7PLEEMM20SntKl0mzKTgkGlxud3GN92JPEAK4gFIf3CbiTsEHf9ohS/HLNu4wRVEHYNCWOMrg=="></script></body></html>
