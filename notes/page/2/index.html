I've made a concerted effort to start publishing more of this information and make the process of migrating these notes technically easier to accomplish. There are times when information may be duplicated from my blog posts, though in different forms. Generally a blog will involve how I came to a conclusion and with additional context and background, while my notes will generally include just the bullet points, commands, and configurations sufficient to accomplish the goal.</p><p>Many of these notes are specific to versions of software that may be outdated and not all of my notes have accurate dates reflecting when I took those notes. I urge you to consider whether the software or topic might have significantly changed since its publication date and where appropriate double check my recommendations and configurations.</p></div><div class=posts-group><div class=post-year>2017</div><ul class=posts-list><li class=post-item><a href=https://stelfox.net/notes/gpg-process-notes/ class=post-item-inner><span class=post-title>GPG Process Notes</span>
