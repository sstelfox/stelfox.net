My opinions may have
also changed dramatically since this was written. It is here as a reference
until I get around to updating it.</strong></em></p><p>The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a protocol for synchronizing the clocks of
computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks. NTP uses
UDP on port 123 as its transport layer. It is designed particularly to resist
the effects of variable latency by using a jitter buffer.</p><p>NTP also refers to a reference software implementation that is distributed by
the NTP Public Services Project.</p><h2 id=security-notes>Security Notes</h2><p>Several authentication schemes and miscellaneous programs running on the
servers rely heavily on closely synced clocks. NTP provides a clock
synchronized to within 10 milliseconds of the other clocks over the internet
and as close as 200 microseconds.</p><p>This runs as an unprivileged user with no shell when run as a server as such
it&rsquo;s compromise could at the very worst make it hand out incorrect time. While
this would mean the authentication schemes and programs wouldn&rsquo;t function
correctly this is something that would be noticed when day to day activity
ceased to function.</p><p>When run as a client, it has to be run as root to update the system&rsquo;s clock. If
an attacker was to compromise the data stream and was able to execute arbitrary
commands in a response packet there would be issues. This is a highly unlikely
scenario. None-the-less I prefer to have them synchronize against a trusted
locally run server.</p><h2 id=firewall-adjustments>Firewall Adjustments</h2><p>NTP synchronizations are allowed through my default <a href=https://stelfox.net/notes/iptables/>IPTables</a> firewall
script. By default it is unrestricted and should be configured to be more
restrictive by replacing it with the one below. You should replace the address
with your time server&rsquo;s address.</p><pre tabindex=0><code># Allow time sync updates, once an ntp server is setup this can be further
# restricted to only update from there.
-A OUTPUT -m udp -p udp --dport 123 -j ACCEPT
</code></pre><p>For the server the opposite should be true. The service should only accept
connections on the local subnets. The following firewall rules should be added
to the firewall.</p><pre tabindex=0><code># Allow other servers and clients on the local subnet to synchronize their
# clocks to this server using ntp
-A SERVICES -m udp -p udp -s 10.13.37.0/24 --dport 123 -j ACCEPT
-A SERVICES -m udp -p udp -s 10.13.38.0/24 --dport 123 -j ACCEPT
</code></pre><h2 id=configuration>Configuration</h2><h3 id=etcntpconf>/etc/ntp.conf</h3><p>A standard configuration of ntp is shown below, there isn&rsquo;t a whole lot to
explain so I&rsquo;ll leave it at that.</p><pre tabindex=0><code># For more information about this file, see the man pages
# ntp.conf(5), ntp_acc(5), ntp_auth(5), ntp_clock(5), ntp_misc(5), ntp_mon(5).

following command to do this:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>chkconfig --level 345 ntpd on

replace the &lsquo;xxxxxxxx&rsquo; in the file <code>/etc/ntp/keys</code>.</p><p>This file should also be protected from read / write from unauthorized users
