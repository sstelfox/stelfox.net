      <title>Cron Daemon</title>

      <description>Cron is a pretty standard utility and there isn&#39;t much to it. I generally use cronie as my cron daemon with the associated anacron. Cron runs tasks periodically, and anacron helps ensure that a missed task will get run if it was off or powercycled when it would have otherwise run.
File Format The config format differs slightly between crontabs, regular cron files, and anacron entries. At the beginning of all the files environment variables can be set using key=value pairs to control the behavior of cron and anacron followed by entries for that file one to a line.</description>

      <description>Syslog-NG is a fast, reliable, and secure syslog daemon that can do advanced processing and log centralization while maintaining a sane configuration file syntax. I&#39;ve recently come to vastly prefer it over my previous long term favorite Rsyslog.
It&#39;s important to note that when modifying the logs statements, they will be processed in order. This means log statements that finalize a message will never make it past that statement. This finalization behavior can be a great tool for optimizing the processing path of logs but can result in unexpected behavior if you don&#39;t pay attention when re-ordering the statements.</description>

      <description>CFSSL is a toolkit of utilities for TLS PKI infrastructures and supports more functionality than I&#39;ve personally needed. It is a fast and convenient way to setup and manage a multi-layer internal certificate authority.
I&#39;ve used it to generate an internal root CA, with sub-CAs for internal only server certificates, and separate CAs for each domain of client certificates (such as VPN, log, mail, and LDAP servers). This allows the root CA to be protected more stringently than specific domains.</description>

      <description>Over the years I&#39;ve found myself using many different naming schemes for servers under my control. I came across a naming convention that finally feels correct. That blog post is quite well written and will let it stand on its own. In the event it ever disappears the important bits (and those where I&#39;ve personalized it) are included here.
There are ultimately two or three DNS names that each host receives.</description>

      <description>I keep a copy of my mutt config both here on the site as well as in my public dotfiles. Eventually I&#39;ll likely document my reasoning, preferences and the tradeoffs made in that config (and change my mind on most in the process).
Vim Since I use vim as my editor I also added the following line to my vim configuration file to autowrap my lines at 72 characters, but only for mutt composed messsages.</description>

      <description>iptables (and ip6tables) is a simple application for interacting directly with the Linux kernel&#39;s netfilter firewall. nftables is attempting to replace it. nftables has better performance but is incredibly complex and difficult to use. Until the tooling and usability around nftables is addressed iptables will likely remain the reigning champion.
It is important that your systems have effective ingress and egress rules. Depending on your host OS, you&#39;ll find your rule set stored in different locations but the following list are where I&#39;ve seen them before:</description>

      <description>This is a very basic operation on a Linux system, but I have to interact with it so rarely since I run either chronyd or ntpd on all of machines. Occasionally, I find a device that needs a helping hand.
On a device with a known good time (or approximate enough):
date +%s This will get you the current unix timestamp. On the target system needing updating as root (replacing &amp;lt;unix timestamp&amp;gt; with the results from the last command):</description>

      <description>Auditd collects any configured syscall execution with critical security metadata associated with the event. This can help enrich other security tools such as AIDE to determine what user and process are responsible for the change.
For reliable operation the rules should be carefully tuned to your system. Tracking every write to disk will generate an unreasonable amount of events and depending on the configuration of the kernel&#39;s audit subsystem, may trigger a kernel panic.</description>

      <description>AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) is a file and directory integrity checker that compares the current hashes, permissions, and attributes of files directories against a known database built from the system.
This can be run periodically to detect manipulation of critical system files, though a motivated attacker with an appropriate level of permissions could modify this database or disable the check as long as the system is able to write to it.</description>

NFC / HTTP Auth dnf install ykpers -y ykpersonalize -n https://api.stelfox.net/sessions/yknfc?t= This will hit the API with a URL like:
https://api.stelfox.net/session/yknfc?t=ccccccuddclhrkuvurcufviveulljleihvreukifegjh The API can then return a token that for accessing additional functionality.
Resetting This will wipe all keys, user, and admin pins on the card.
This requires scdaemon and gpg-agent to be working and able to connect to the smartcard.</description>

      <description>I followed the TAILS setup guide to get a secure offline environment running to perform this generation task. The steps I took are documented in the tails document.
Initial Key Creation For simplicity I wanted to clear out the GnuPG configuration that starts out in place. Makes things a lot nicer later on.
rm -rf ~/.gnupg/* I pulled in the .gnupg/gpg.conf from my dotfiles by hand.

      <description>GRE encapsulates all layer 2 traffic, but does so through an unencrypted tunnel. Sensitive traffic should exclusively go through a lower level encrypted tunnel like IPSec.
Firewall The following iptables need to be enabled to allow the GRE traffic to and from the system. This should be restricted to / from IP addresses as well.

      <description>Amanda, or the Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver is an open source computer archiving tool that is able to back up data residing on multiple computers on a network.
I am not a huge fan of having xinetd or perl on my system and this is reliant on both, however, there does not currently seem to be any reasonable open source alternatives that support managing a tape library.
My notes on setting this up were incomplete and woefully outdated so I removed them.</description>

Asterisk is a software implementation of a telephone private branch exchange (PBX) originally created in 1999 by Mark Spencer of Digium. Like any PBX, it allows attached telephones to make calls to one another, and to connect to other telephone services including the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services.</description>

-A INPUT -p udp -m udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT If you&#39;re running named in a chroot you&#39;ll also need to add the following line to rsyslog&#39;s configuration file so that the chroot doesn&#39;t break named&#39;s logging.</description>

      <description>Recovering Data from Swap Sometimes useful bits of information can be recovered from swap. Whether it&#39;s encryption keys, documents that were being worked on or anything else that might&#39;ve ended up in RAM. To search through the swap for interesting bits (and depending on the size this might take a while) you can execute the following command as root or sudo to do it:
[root@localhost ~]# strings `/bin/swapon -s | tail -1 | awk &#39;{print $1}&#39;` | less The command above uses the swapon utility to list all of the swap devices in use; look at the last line of the output (most people only have one swap device); extract only the path to the device node.</description>

Duplicity is a command line backup utility that makes use of the rsync libraries to perform incremental backups. It also can use GPG public/private keypairs to handle backing up and restoring files.
I personally want to use public / private key pairs for my backups and contrary with what I do most of the time I share a single public / private key pair for my backups, with a strong pass string on the private key.</description>

      <description>If you&#39;ve already implemented the SSH keys for authentication and have a password on your key then you&#39;ve already achieved multi-factor authentication to a certain degree.
The gatekeeper script is something that I haven&#39;t come across on any other systems that other people administer. Perhaps it&#39;s too much trouble for them without much gain. I had the idea for this while watching a James Bond movie.
A Russian systems engineer put riddles on one of his machines that you had to go through in order to access the system, while this alone isn&#39;t secure, asking the user random questions after authentication couldn&#39;t hurt security.</description>

The device name will more likely than not be either eth0 or em1, though occasionally I&#39;ve seen ethernet addresses along the lines of p12p1 (which is a terrible naming convention that bothers the hell out of me but I understand why the linux developers switched to this naming convention).</description>

Secure Shell or SSH is a network protocol that allows data to be exchanged using a secure channel between two networked devices. Used primarily on GNU/Linux and Unix based systems to access shell accounts, SSH was designed as a replacement for Telnet and other insecure remote shells, which send information, notably passwords, in plaintext, rendering them susceptible to packet analysis.</description>
