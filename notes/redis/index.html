<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<pre><code>yum install redis -y
</code></pre>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

<p>Default configuration:</p>

<pre><code>############### GENERAL ###############

# Daemonize the Redis process and write out the specified PID file
#
daemonize no
pidfile /var/run/redis/redis.pid

# TCP Listen mode, if bind is not specified it will listen on all available
# interfaces
#
bind 127.0.0.1
port 6379

# Specify the path for the unix socket that will be used to listen for incoming
# connections. There is no default, so Redis will not listen on a unix socket
# when not specified.
#
#unixsocket /tmp/redis.sock
#unixsocketperm 755

# Close the connection after a client is idle for N seconds (0 to disable)
#
timeout 30
tcp-keepalive 5

# Set the log output:
#   debug (a lot of information, useful for development/testing)
#   verbose (many rarely useful info, but not a mess like the debug level)
#   notice (moderately verbose, what you want in production probably)
#   warning (only very important / critical messages are logged)
#
loglevel notice

# Specify the log file name. Also 'stdout' can be used to force Redis to log on
# the standard output. Note that if you use standard output for logging but
# daemonize, logs will be sent to /dev/null
#
logfile /var/log/redis/redis.log

# To enable logging to the system logger, just set 'syslog-enabled' to yes, and
# optionally update the other syslog parameters to suit your needs.
#
syslog-enabled yes

# Specify the syslog identity.
#
syslog-ident redis

# Specify the syslog facility.  Must be USER or between LOCAL0-LOCAL7.
#
syslog-facility local0

# Set the number of databases. The default database is DB 0, you can select a
# different one on a per-connection basis using SELECT &lt;dbid&gt; where dbid is a
# number between 0 and 'databases' - 1
#
databases 16

############### SNAPSHOTTING ###############

# The name of the file to sync the in memory database too.
#
dbfilename database.rdb

# The working directory.
#
# The DB will be written inside this directory, with the filename specified
# above using the 'dbfilename' configuration directive. Also the Append Only
# File will be created inside this directory. Note that you must specify a
# directory here, not a file name.
#
dir /var/lib/redis/

# Compress string objects using LZF when dump .rdb databases? For default that's
# set to 'yes' as it's almost always a win. If you want to save some CPU in the
# saving child set it to 'no' but the dataset will likely be bigger if you have
# compressible values or keys.
#
rdbcompression yes

# Save the DB on disk:
#   save &lt;seconds&gt; &lt;changes&gt;
#
# Will save the DB if both the given number of seconds and the given number of
# write operations against the DB occurred. In the configuration below, the
# database will be saved when any of the following rules are matched:
#
#   after 900 sec (15 min) if at least 1 key changed
#   after 300 sec (5 min) if at least 10 keys changed
#   after 60 sec if at least 10000 keys changed
#
# You can disable saving to disk at all commenting all the &quot;save&quot; lines.
#
save 900 1
save 300 10
save  60 10000

############### REPLICATION ###############

# Master-Slave replication. Use slaveof to make a Redis instance a copy of
# another Redis server. Note that the configuration is local to the slave so for
# example it is possible to configure the slave to save the DB with a different
# interval, or to listen to another port, and so on.
#
#slaveof &lt;masterip&gt; &lt;masterport&gt;

# If the master is password protected (using the &quot;requirepass&quot; configuration
# directive below) it is possible to tell the slave to authenticate before
# starting the replication synchronization process, otherwise the master will
# refuse the slave request.
#
#masterauth &lt;master-password&gt;

# When a slave lost the connection with the master, or when the replication is
# still in progress, the slave can act in two different ways:
#
# 1) if slave-serve-stale-data is set to 'yes' (the default) the slave will
#    still reply to client requests, possibly with out of data data, or the data
#    set may just be empty if this is the first synchronization.
#
# 2) if slave-serve-stale data is set to 'no' the slave will reply with an error
#    &quot;SYNC with master in progress&quot; to all the kind of commands but to INFO and
#    SLAVEOF.
#
slave-serve-stale-data yes

# Slaves send PINGs to server in a predefined interval. It's possible to change
# this interval with the repl_ping_slave_period option. The default value is 10
# seconds.
#
repl-ping-slave-period 10

# The following option sets a timeout for both Bulk transfer I/O timeout and
# master data or ping response timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.
#
# It is important to make sure that this value is greater than the value
# specified for repl-ping-slave-period otherwise a timeout will be detected every
# time there is low traffic between the master and the slave.
#
repl-timeout 60

############### SECURITY ###############

# Require clients to issue AUTH &lt;PASSWORD&gt; before processing any other commands.
# This might be useful in environments in which you do not trust others with
# access to the host running redis-server.
#
# This should stay commented out for backward compatibility and because most
# people do not need auth (e.g. they run their own servers).
#
# Warning: since Redis is pretty fast an outside user can try up to 150k
# passwords per second against a good box. This means that you should use a very
# strong password otherwise it will be very easy to break.
#
requirepass xRDdPoEtcB6DtrRhuMDi1B1TXa0h3hNhxmaFWzruZdFd9hBJnNqzkY0pRY7UVxf5

# Command renaming.
#
# It is possilbe to change the name of dangerous commands in a shared
# environment. For instance the CONFIG command may be renamed into something of
# hard to guess so that it will be still available for internal-use tools but
# not available for general clients.
#
#   rename-command CONFIG b840fc02d524045429941cc15f59e41cb7be6c52
#
# It is also possilbe to completely kill a command renaming it into an empty
# string:
#
#   rename-command CONFIG &quot;&quot;
#
# The following commands are potentially dangerous and they've either been
# renamed if they seem legitimately useful or disabled completely otherwise.
# Most of the commands that have been disabled are configuration options that
# should be specified in this file.

rename-command CLIENT &quot;&quot;
rename-command CONFIG &quot;&quot;
rename-command SLAVEOF &quot;&quot;

rename-command MONITOR &quot;&quot;
rename-command OBJECT &quot;&quot;

rename-command FLUSHALL &quot;&quot;
rename-command FLUSHDB &quot;&quot;

rename-command EVAL &quot;&quot;
rename-command EVALSHA &quot;&quot;
rename-command SCRIPT &quot;&quot;

############### LIMITS ###############

# Set the max number of connected clients at the same time. By default there is
# no limit, and it's up to the number of file descriptors the Redis process is
# able to open. The special value '0' means no limits. Once the limit is reached
# Redis will close all the new connections sending an error 'max number of
# clients reached'.
#
maxclients 128

# Don't use more memory than the specified amount of bytes. When the memory
# limit is reached Redis will try to remove keys accordingly to the eviction
# policy selected (see maxmemmory-policy).
#
# If Redis can't remove keys according to the policy, or if the policy is set to
# 'noeviction', Redis will start to reply with errors to commands that would use
# more memory, like SET, LPUSH, and so on, and will continue to reply to
# read-only commands like GET.
#
# This option is usually useful when using Redis as an LRU cache, or to set a
# hard memory limit for an instance (using the 'noeviction' policy).
#
# WARNING: If you have slaves attached to an instance with maxmemory on, the
# size of the output buffers needed to feed the slaves are subtracted from the
# used memory count, so that network problems / resyncs will not trigger a loop
# where keys are evicted, and in turn the output buffer of slaves is full with
# DELs of keys evicted triggering the deletion of more keys, and so forth until
# the database is completely emptied.
#
# In short... if you have slaves attached it is suggested that you set a lower
# limit for maxmemory so that there is some free RAM on the system for slave
# output buffers (but this is not needed if the policy is 'noeviction').
#
#maxmemory 512Mb

# MAXMEMORY POLICY: how Redis will select what to remove when maxmemory is
# reached? You can select among five behavior:
#
# volatile-lru: remove keys with an expire set using an LRU algorithm (default)
# allkeys-lru: remove any key accordingly to the LRU algorithm
# volatile-random: remove a random key with an expire set
# allkeys-&gt;random: remove a random key, any key
# volatile-ttl: remove the key with the nearest expire time (minor TTL)
# noeviction: don't expire at all, just return an error on write operations
#
# Note: with all the kind of policies, Redis will return an error on write
# operations, when there are not suitable keys for eviction.
#
# At the date of writing this commands are: set setnx setex append incr decr
# rpush lpush rpushx lpushx linsert lset rpoplpush sadd sinter sinterstore
# sunion sunionstore sdiff sdiffstore zadd zincrby zunionstore zinterstore hset
# hsetnx hmset hincrby incrby decrby getset mset msetnx exec sort
#
#maxmemory-policy volatile-lru

# LRU and minimal TTL algorithms are not precise algorithms but approximated
# algorithms (in order to save memory), so you can select as well the sample
# size to check. For instance for default Redis will check three keys and
# pick the one that was used less recently, you can change the sample size
# using the following configuration directive.
#
#maxmemory-samples 3

############### APPEND ONLY MODE ###############

# By default Redis asynchronously dumps the dataset on disk. If you can live
# with the idea that the latest records will be lost if something like a crash
# happens this is the preferred way to run Redis. If instead you care a lot
# about your data and don't want to that a single record can get lost you should
# enable the append only mode: when this mode is enabled Redis will append every
# write operation received in the file appendonly.aof. This file will be read on
# startup in order to rebuild the full dataset in memory.
#
# Note that you can have both the async dumps and the append only file if you
# like (you have to comment the &quot;save&quot; statements above to disable the dumps).
# Still if append only mode is enabled Redis will load the data from the log
# file at startup ignoring the dump.rdb file.
#
# IMPORTANT: Check the BGREWRITEAOF to check how to rewrite the append log file
# in background when it gets too big.
#
appendonly no

# The name of the append only file (default: &quot;appendonly.aof&quot;)
#
appendfilename appendonly.aof

# The fsync() call tells the Operating System to actually write data on disk
# instead to wait for more data in the output buffer. Some OS will really flush
# data on disk, some other OS will just try to do it ASAP.
#
# Redis supports three different modes:
#
# no: don't fsync, just let the OS flush the data when it wants. Faster.
# always: fsync after every write to the append only log. Slow, Safest.
# everysec: fsync only if one second passed since the last fsync. Compromise.
#
# The default is &quot;everysec&quot; that's usually the right compromise between speed
# and data safety. It's up to you to understand if you can relax this to &quot;no&quot;
# that will will let the operating system flush the output buffer when it wants,
# for better performances (but if you can live with the idea of some data loss
# consider the default persistence mode that's snapshotting), or on the
# contrary, use &quot;always&quot; that's very slow but a bit safer than everysec.
#
# If unsure, use &quot;everysec&quot;.
#
appendfsync everysec

# When the AOF fsync policy is set to always or everysec, and a background
# saving process (a background save or AOF log background rewriting) is
# performing a lot of I/O against the disk, in some Linux configurations Redis
# may block too long on the fsync() call. Note that there is no fix for this
# currently, as even performing fsync in a different thread will block our
# synchronous write(2) call.
#
# In order to mitigate this problem it's possible to use the following option
# that will prevent fsync() from being called in the main process while a BGSAVE
# or BGREWRITEAOF is in progress.
#
# This means that while another child is saving the durability of Redis is the
# same as &quot;appendfsync none&quot;, that in pratical terms means that it is possible
# to lost up to 30 seconds of log in the worst scenario (with the default Linux
# settings).
#
# If you have latency problems turn this to &quot;yes&quot;. Otherwise leave it as &quot;no&quot;
# that is the safest pick from the point of view of durability.
#
no-appendfsync-on-rewrite no

# Automatic rewrite of the append only file. Redis is able to automatically
# rewrite the log file implicitly calling BGREWRITEAOF when the AOF log size
# will growth by the specified percentage.
#
# This is how it works: Redis remembers the size of the AOF file after the
# latest rewrite (or if no rewrite happened since the restart, the size of the
# AOF at startup is used).
#
# This base size is compared to the current size. If the current size is bigger
# than the specified percentage, the rewrite is triggered. Also you need to
# specify a minimal size for the AOF file to be rewritten, this is useful to
# avoid rewriting the AOF file even if the percentage increase is reached but it
# is still pretty small.
#
# Specify a precentage of zero in order to disable the automatic AOF rewrite
# feature.
#
auto-aof-rewrite-min-size 64mb
auto-aof-rewrite-percentage 100

############### SLOW LOG ###############

# The Redis Slow Log is a system to log queries that exceeded a specified
# execution time. The execution time does not include the I/O operations like
# talking with the client, sending the reply and so forth, but just the time
# needed to actually execute the command (this is the only stage of command
# execution where the thread is blocked and can not serve other requests in the
# meantime).
#
# You can configure the slow log with two parameters: one tells Redis what is
# the execution time, in microseconds, to exceed in order for the command to get
# logged, and the other parameter is the length of the slow log. When a new
# command is logged the oldest one is removed from the queue of logged commands.
#
# The following time is expressed in microseconds, so 1000000 is equivalent to
# one second. Note that a negative number disables the slow log, while a value
# of zero forces the logging of every command.
#
slowlog-log-slower-than 10000

# There is no limit to this length. Just be aware that it will consume memory.
# You can reclaim memory used by the slow log with SLOWLOG RESET.
#
slowlog-max-len 1024

############### VIRTUAL MEMORY ###############

### WARNING! Virtual Memory is deprecated in Redis 2.4
### The use of Virtual Memory is strongly discouraged.

# Virtual Memory allows Redis to work with datasets bigger than the actual
# amount of RAM needed to hold the whole dataset in memory. In order to do so
# very used keys are taken in memory while the other keys are swapped into a
# swap file, similarly to what operating systems do with memory pages.
#
# To enable VM just set 'vm-enabled' to yes, and set the following three VM
# parameters accordingly to your needs.
#
vm-enabled no

# This is the path of the Redis swap file. As you can guess, swap files can't be
# shared by different Redis instances, so make sure to use a swap file for every
# redis process you are running. Redis will complain if the swap file is already
# in use.
#
# The best kind of storage for the Redis swap file (that's accessed at random)
# is a Solid State Disk (SSD).
#
# *** WARNING *** if you are using a shared hosting the default of putting the
# swap file under /tmp is not secure. Create a dir with access granted only to
# Redis user and configure Redis to create the swap file there.
#
vm-swap-file /tmp/redis.swap

# vm-max-memory configures the VM to use at max the specified amount of RAM.
# Everything that deos not fit will be swapped on disk *if* possible, that is,
# if there is still enough contiguous space in the swap file.
#
# With vm-max-memory 0 the system will swap everything it can. Not a good
# default, just specify the max amount of RAM you can in bytes, but it's better
# to leave some margin. For instance specify an amount of RAM that's more or
# less between 60 and 80% of your free RAM.
#
vm-max-memory 0

# Redis swap files is split into pages. An object can be saved using multiple
# contiguous pages, but pages can't be shared between different objects. So if
# your page is too big, small objects swapped out on disk will waste a lot of
# space. If you page is too small, there is less space in the swap file
# (assuming you configured the same number of total swap file pages).
#
# If you use a lot of small objects, use a page size of 64 or 32 bytes.
# If you use a lot of big objects, use a bigger page size.
# If unsure, use the default :)
#
vm-page-size 32

# Number of total memory pages in the swap file. Given that the page table (a
# bitmap of free/used pages) is taken in memory, every 8 pages on disk will
# consume 1 byte of RAM.
#
# The total swap size is vm-page-size * vm-pages
#
# With the default of 32-bytes memory pages and 134217728 pages Redis will use a
# 4 GB swap file, that will use 16 MB of RAM for the page table.
#
# It's better to use the smallest acceptable value for your application, but the
# default is large in order to work in most conditions.
#
vm-pages 134217728

# Max number of VM I/O threads running at the same time. This threads are used
# to read/write data from/to swap file, since they also encode and decode
# objects from disk to memory or the reverse, a bigger number of threads can
# help with big objects even if they can't help with I/O itself as the physical
# device may not be able to couple with many reads/writes operations at the same
# time.
#
# The special value of 0 turn off threaded I/O and enables the blocking Virtual
# Memory implementation.
#
vm-max-threads 4

############### ADVANCED CONFIG ###############

# Hashes are encoded in a special way (much more memory efficient) when they
# have at max a given numer of elements, and the biggest element does not exceed
# a given threshold. You can configure this limits with the following
# configuration directives.
#
hash-max-zipmap-entries 512
hash-max-zipmap-value 64

# Similarly to hashes, small lists are also encoded in a special way in order to
# save a lot of space. The special representation is only used when you are under
# the following limits:
#
list-max-ziplist-entries 512
list-max-ziplist-value 64

# Sets have a special encoding in just one case: when a set is composed of just
# strings that happens to be integers in radix 10 in the range of 64 bit signed
# integers. The following configuration setting sets the limit in the size of
# the set in order to use this special memory saving encoding.
#
set-max-intset-entries 512

# Similarly to hashes and lists, sorted sets are also specially encoded in order
# to save a lot of space. This encoding is only used when the length and
# elements of a sorted set are below the following limits:
#
zset-max-ziplist-entries 128
zset-max-ziplist-value 64

# Active rehashing uses 1 millisecond every 100 milliseconds of CPU time in
# order to help rehashing the main Redis hash table (the one mapping top-level
# keys to values). The hash table implementation redis uses (see dict.c)
# performs a lazy rehashing: the more operation you run into an hash table that
# is rhashing, the more rehashing &quot;steps&quot; are performed, so if the server is
# idle the rehashing is never complete and some more memory is used by the hash
# table.
#
# The default is to use this millisecond 10 times every second in order to
# active rehashing the main dictionaries, freeing memory when possible.
#
# Use &quot;activerehashing no&quot;. If you have hard latency requirements and it is not
# a good thing in your environment that Redis can reply form time to time to
# queries with 2 milliseconds delay.
#
# use &quot;activerehashing yes&quot; if you don't have such hard requirements but want to
# free memory asap when possible.
#
activerehashing yes

############### INCLUDES ###############
# Include one or more other config files here. This is useful if you have a
# standard template that goes to all redis server but also need to customize a
# few per-server settings. Include files can include other files, so use this
# wisely.
