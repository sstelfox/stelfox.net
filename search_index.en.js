I guess I\nshould expect that kind of anti-competitive behavior from a business that\nDonald Trump has a vested interest in.\nI've come across one post on a forum that seems to have been crawled and copied\nout every where. The poster had cracked it and got it working with an Asterisk\nserver which is what my ultimate goal for this phone is, however they claim to\nhave done it by getting root through telnet. The problem being that port 23\n(telnet) is not open so this was a dead end.\nThis is a running document of how I'm doing it, you'll notice that I'm writing\nthis as I go.\nReconnaissance\nFirst thing's first a little run down of what I've found. I can change the\nnetwork address and the way it's handling networking (either bridged or NAT). I\ncan not get into the Administrators menu which is where all the juicy bits seem\nto be. I've found that the factory reset code is 7517517, though that doesn't\nget me anything beyond cleaning up it's last known phone number.\nThrough a very thorough nmap scan I've found that ports TCP 21, 79, 113, 513,\n514, 554, 5060, 7022, and 8080 are all open. There doesn't appear to be any UDP\nports available which actually surprised me, since SIP over UDP is pretty\ncommon.\n7022 and 8080 both immediately caught my eye. 7022 looks like someone moved SSH\n(port 22) to a non-standard port, and 8080 is a very common alternate port for\nHTTP. Connecting to 7022 via telnet confirmed my suspicions of SSH. I received\nthis prompt:\nConnected to 10.0.0.85.\nEscape character is '^]'.\nSSH-2.0-dropbear_0.45\n\nBingo. SSH it is, and an old version of dropbear at that. Unfortunately as the\none poster I found said the password was neither blank nor 'root'. I suspect\nthat they had an older firmware revision and these 'bugs' were ironed out in a\nlater revision. That's OK though it'll just take a bit more work.\nAs for port 8080 it is definitely running a web configuration interface. All it\nasks for is a password (which we don't have). The extension for the login page\n(esp) makes me suspect that the Iris device is running a copy of AppWebServer\nor something similar and using embedded javascript as the server side\nprocessing. For now that doesn't provide much but it could be very useful later\non.\nAttack\nSo while looking for an exploit for DropBear 0.45 I started up a SSH dictionary\nattack and encountered by first real problem. The screen started blinking while\nrunning three or more threads trying to break in, at first I thought it was\nkind of funny but then it turned off completely.\nTurns out the adapter I have for it is only rated for pushing out 500mA and the\nphone itself takes up to 1500mA, apparently I hit that limit and browned-out\nthe phone. It still seems to work but if I want to take this route I'll need a\nmore robust power supply. Looking around I found a 1500mA supply and after\nchecking the boards for damage I gave it a shot and everything seems to be\nworking OK.\nUnfortunately I wasn't able to find any viable exploits for that particular\nDropBear version as the vulnerabilities that had been found were either DoS\nvulnerabilities or were only useful with valid credentials.\nThe basic dictionary attack failed and I started up a more comprehensive one. I\ncould easily start brute forcing this but it would take a very long time,\nespecially if the company realized that a weak password wasn't cutting it.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2011/exploration-of-a-acn-iris-3000/","title":"Exploration of an ACN Iris 3000"},"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2011/linux-n-issues-kde-multi-monitor-woes/":{"body":"So I recently did a fresh install of Fedora 14 with KDE installed (not the KDE\nspin mind you) on my ThinkPad.

So when I started\nseeing this behavior I expected that issue to have cropped up again.\nThe actual behavior that I was witnessing was this:\n\nConnect to wireless network\nUse the connection for 5-10 seconds\nPages would start timing out even though the connection was still 'active'\n\nDisconnecting and reconnecting to the wireless would start the situation all\nover again, which quickly became frustrating but I didn't have time to mess\nwith it so I just plugged into an ethernet port and went about my business.\nThe next day I received my the logwatch from my laptop (Yes, my laptop sends\nit's logs to my email) and it mentioned more than 20,000 new entries of an\nerror I've never seen before:\niwlagn 0000:03:00.0: BA scd_flow 0 does not match txq_id 10\n\nAfter poking around a bit online I found that the issue is with a recent kernel\nupdate (I'm currently running 2.6.35.11-83) changing the behavior of some\nsanity checks to wireless connections that support 'N'. Turns out my wireless\ncard and all the networks I was having issues with support 'N'. Good to know.\nIt was easy enough to solve that issue, the kernel module just needed an option\npassed to it that I believe just disables 'N'. This is all well and good but I\nhaven't had to manually pass options to a kernel module for a couple of\nreleases now (I think the last was Fedora 10). Since then the file\n/etc/modules.conf has been deprecated in favor of placing files in\n/etc/modules.d/. There are some files that come stock in there but none are\npassing parameters to modules and the naming scheme doesn't seem to conform to\nanything.\nI was unsure if there was something specific I had to name the file or if it\nneeded to be in one of the existing files. I ended up creating the\nfile /etc/modprobe.d/iwlagn.conf and putting the following in it:\noptions iwlagn 11n_disable=1\n# This one might be needed instead\n#options iwlagn 11n_disable50=1\n\nAfter I rebooted the problem vanished like it was never there. If you notice\nthere is a second option in there that is commented out. I found some people\nwhere the first option didn't work but replacing it with that second option\ndid, so if one doesn't work for you try the second option.\nThe second issue that I encountered was just this morning. I'm working at a\nremote site today that I'm not at very often, and am using my laptop as my\ndesktop workhorse. Usually when I'm at a remote site, I steal an office that\nisn't in use and claim it as my own, and today was no different. There was a\nscreen in this office that had its power plugged it but it's VGA cable was just\nsitting there. I figured 'why not?' so I plugged it in and KDE happily\nannounced that it detected a new display and offered to take me to the settings\ninterface that would allow me to configure it.\n\"Awesome!\" I thought, multiple desktops has always been one of those things I\nhad to tweak and search around for and it looks like KDE is making some serious\nstrides in their support for it. When I turned it on I wasn't really paying\nattention to the settings and my laptop display ended up on the wrong side of\nthe screen and my primary desktop on the LCD. Not exactly what I wanted but\nit's cool that it was that easy to setup.\nI went back into the configuration options switched things around, but no\nmatter what I did, the 'primary desktop' was always on the external monitor.\nWhat's more is that there isn't any option for selecting the primary display!\nThat used to be there...\nI hunted around before getting frustrated and searching around online. Sure\nenough other people were annoyed by this regression but the solution was very\neasy (though it appears you have to do it every time).\nTo set the primary monitor to my laptop screen (LCDS1) I just opened a shell\nand put this in:\nxrandr --output LCDS1 --primary\n\nPoof! Everything is all set and I'm happy once again. I hope that the KDE\ndevelopers put back the primary display selection in the settings but for now\nit's easy enough. Hopefully this will help other people on the net.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2011/linux-n-issues-kde-multi-monitor-woes/","title":"Linux N Issues & KDE Multi-Monitor Woes"},"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2011/the-home-network-and-nat-as-a-security-layer/":{"body":"One of the hot-topics for IPv6 (which I have been thinking about a lot lately)\nis NAT. I normally wouldn't go into detail about specifics that are obvious to\npeople in my field but for the sake of this post I will. NAT or Network Address\nTranslation, is a way for a large number of computers to share a single public\nIP address.\nThe router that is handling the NAT will keep track of connections coming in\nand out of it and re-write the destination IP to an internal address to keep\nthe traffic flowing.\nNAT was necessary with IPv4 because IPv4 only had 4,294,967,296 addresses on\nthe internet and quite a few those were unroutable or reserved. With a world\npopulation of 7 billion only half the population of the planet could have a\nsingle device online at a time. IPv6 solves this issue by increasing the number\nof public routable address to 3.4x10^38. That means that each person alive\ncould have 4.9x10^28 addresses online at any given time.\nSo what does this mean for NAT? Clearly we don't need it any more right? There\nis no way I'll ever use 4.9x10^28 addresses. I'm willing to bet Google doesn't\nown that many machines. Well this is where the debate starts. NAT was never\ndesigned to be used as a security tool and it has even had some security\nramifications because of it.\nThe weakness of NAT is also it's primary strength. What do I mean by that? You\ncan't attack a computer if you can't talk to it. In my opinion, this alone has\nprotected innumerable regular home users from all kinds of terrible things\nonline. A standard COTS router that comes with most internet connections will\nstop port-scans and automated attack tools at the door.\nSounds good right? So why would people be opposed to it? Simple. It complicates\nthings. There are a limited number of simultaneous connections that can go\nthrough a single NAT device. This hard limit of 65,536 connections (in reality\nthis number is an order of magnitude less - 32,768) isn't changed between IPv4\nand IPv6 and there really isn't a good reason to change it. Sounds like a lot\nbut trust me it gets used up quickly.\nThere is also identity reasons, behind a NAT could be 100 people or 1 and to\nthe rest of the world it will all look the same. If someone breaks into a home\nnetwork there isn't any way to differentiate that cracker from a normal user to\nthe outside world. This privacy also gives home users plausible deniability for\nanything that happens on their network.\nBut those arguments against have very little to do with security. So what is\nall this hype about NAT being a form of security through obscurity? The\nargument I come across whenever I ask naysayers about NAT, is that if a user\ngets infected then the network can still be enumerated behind the NAT as if all\nthe computers were on the Internet. This argument has one fatal flaw. It is\ndepending on a user to get infected. A firewall has this exact same\n\"vulnerability\" so would they argue that a firewall is not a layer of security?\nI thought not.\nNAT has it's problems, but claiming it is not a security layer is just plain\nwrong. IPv6 is here to stay and we should really start looking at the security\nimplications of everything involving it. New security models need to be created\nand lots of of research needs to be done in this area still. In the mean time I\nsuspect a lot of malware and viruses will start making use of IPv6 and how\nrelatively unknown it really is.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2011/the-home-network-and-nat-as-a-security-layer/","title":"The Home Network and NAT as a Security Layer"},"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2012/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2012/","title":""},"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2012/adding-a-table-prefix-to-datamapper-tables/":{"body":"So I recently encountered a situation where I needed to define a prefix on the\ntables used by the \"data_mapper\" gem. When I went searching I found quite a bit\nof information about similar projects in Python, and PHP named DataMapper but\nnothing about the ruby \"data_mapper\". The search continued eventually ending in\nmy reading through the source of the data_mapper gem only to find that there\nwas no feature for simply defining a prefix.\nReading through the source though did allow me to find any easy way to\nimplement such functionality. The following snippet is a minimalist data_mapper\ninitialization and setup of one model with a table prefix of source_ (chosen\nat random and of no significance).\n# encoding: utf-8\n\n# (1)\nrequire \"dm-core\"\nrequire \"dm-migrations\"\n\n# (2)\nmodule PrefixNamingConvention\n  def self.call(model_name)\n    # (3)\n    prefix = \"source_\"\n    # (4)\n    table_name = DataMapper::NamingConventions::Resource::UnderscoredAndPluralized.call(model_name)\n\n    \"#{prefix}#{table_name}\"\n  end\nend\n\n# (5)\nDataMapper::Logger.new($stdout, :debug)\n\n# (6)\nDataMapper.setup(:default, \"sqlite:example.db\")\nDataMapper.repository(:default).adapter.resource_naming_convention = PrefixNamingConvention\n\n# (7)\nclass Person\n  include DataMapper::Resource\n\n  property :id, Serial\n  property :first_name, String\n  property :last_name, String\n  property :email, String\nend\n\n# (8)\nDataMapper.finalize\nDataMapper.auto_upgrade!\n\nSo here are some notes on what's going on in this snippet. Each area that I\nwill be discussing has been annotated with a number like \"# (1)\" to make it\neasier to find a section you have questions about.\n\nSince this is an example I'm only including the bare minimum data mapper\ngems to accomplish the task. If you're using bundler you may need to also\nrequire \"rubygems\" to get this too work.\nThis is where the real work happens, DataMapper uses external modules that\nreceive the \"call\" method to handle the conversion of class names to table\nnames. By default DataMapper uses the module\n\"DataMapper::NamingConventions::Resource::UnderscoredAndPluralized\", which\nI'll use later to maintain the same names.\nThis is where I'm defining the table prefix. This could be defined in a\nglobal, call another method or class, whatever your heart desires to get a\nstring that will be used as a prefix.\nHere I'm getting what DataMapper would have named the table if I wasn't\ninterferring\nI'm logging to standard out so that I can see the queries called to verify\nthat DataMapper is creating tables with the names that I want. This is used\nlater on in this post to demonstrate this solution working, however, it\ncould be left out without affecting anything.\nInitial setup of a sqlite database, and then the good stuff. Once a database\nhas been setup with a specific adapter you can change the naming convention\nDataMapper will use to generate table names. This is accomplished by passing\nthe module constant name through the repositories adapter and too\n\"resource_naming_convention\" as demonstrated in the code.\nHere I'm defining an example model of no importance. This is purely for\ndemonstration, normally DataMapper would name this model \"people\".\nInform DataMapper we're done setting it up and to run the migrations to\ncreate the model defined.\n\nWhen you run this ruby file (assuming you have the \"data_mapper\" and\n\"dm-sqlite-adapter\" gem installed) you'll see output very similar too this:\n~ (0.001402) PRAGMA table_info(\"source_people\")\n~ (0.000089) SELECT sqlite_version(*)\n~ (0.077840) CREATE TABLE \"source_people\" (\"id\" INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, \"first_name\" VARCHAR(50), \"last_name\" VARCHAR(50), \"email\" VARCHAR(50))\n\nNotice the third line? Specifically the name of the table? It's named exactly\nas it would have been except now it has a prefix of \"source_\".\nHope this saves someone else some trouble.

Looking back on the code I see some things I'm impressed\nwith, but the majority of the code I wouldn't write today. That's not to say\nthe code is bad, or doesn't function. It did exactly what I wanted to\naccomplish at the time, just not necessarily in the most efficient way.\nThis archive of old code made me start wondering how much old code I'm using in\nthe projects that I'm currently writing. Not code that I've written but code\nthat I'm depending on, specifically gems. As of this writing I have 26 active\nruby projects in various states of development all of which make use of RVM and\nbundler.\nConveniently enough, bundler provides an easy way to update all the gems\ninstalled in a project unless specific version information was provided in the\nGemfile.

I did not keep track of unique gems so the four Rails projects\nprobably had a lot of duplicate gems each one more or less likely to have\ndifferent versions of different gems installed depending on when I started the\nproject.\nAcross all of the different projects I had 2214 gems installed.

Running through the thousands of tests in all of the projects I had\nexactly 7 tests that were now failing and they were all due too projects that\nremoved or renamed a piece of functionality that I was making use of. In one\ncase I had to extend the core Hash method to replace the functionality.

This isn't particularly unusual but it was\nthe first time from within a Ruby application. Luckily enough Ruby has a built\nin XMLRPC client that handles a lot of the messy bits.\nThe XMLRPC::Client class itself seems fairly simple. There are only a handful\nof methods, five of which are for opening a new connection in a few different\nways, and at least two ways to open each type of connection.\nAs a starting point this was a simplified chunk of code that I was using to\nconnect to the remote API:\nrequire 'xmlrpc/client'\n\nclass APIConnection\n  def initialize(username, password, host)\n    # Build the arguments for the XMLRPC::Client object\n    conn_args = {\n      :user =&gt; username,\n      :password =&gt; password,\n      :host =&gt; host,\n      :use_ssl =&gt; true,\n      :path =&gt; \"/api\"\n    }\n\n    @connection = XMLRPC::Client.new_from_hash(conn_args)\n  end\n\n  def version\n    @connection.call(\"version\")\n  end\nend\n\nThe problem I ran into was when connecting to a server using HTTPS. I knew that\nthis certificate was good however I continued to get the message:\nwarning: peer certificate won't be verified in this SSL session\n\nRuby has taken the approach of by default not including any trusted certificate\nauthorities which I greatly appreciate especially considering that in 2010 and\n2011 12 certificate authorities were known to have been hacked including major\nones such as VeriSign, and DigiNotar. Some of which were proven to\nhave issued false certificates.\nSince XMLRPC::Client doesn't expose it's SSL trust settings through it's\nmethods I went on a bit of a journey through Google to find an answer. What I\nfound was overly disturbing, a lot of people don't seem to understand what SSL\nis actually for. The solutions I found from the most egregious to least:\n\nDisabling OpenSSL certificate checking globally with OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE\nOverriding the Net::HTTP certificate checking\nDisabling OpenSSL certificate checking locally by extending XMLRPC::Client\nand over-riding how it was establishing connections\nUsing an SSL stripping proxy\n\nI couldn't find a solution out there that didn't the security conscious voice\nin my head scream in despair. I asked on StackOverflow for a good\nsolution. When I asked I didn't have a good grasp on how Ruby was handling SSL\ncertificates at all. The thorough answer from emboss didn't quite answer\nmy question but it gave me more than enough to really hunt down what I wanted.\nFirst stop, I needed the certificates that I'll be using to verify the\nconnection. Every single certificate authority that issues certificates for\npublic websites makes the public portion of their certificates available and\nthis is what we need to verify the connection. To find out which ones you\nspecifically need you can go to the API server's address and look at it's\ncertificate information by clicking on the site's lock icon. Every browser is a\nlittle different so you'll have to find this out on your own. With Chrome (and\nperhaps others) you can download each of the certificates in the chain that\nyou'll need to verify the server's certificate.\nThe server I was connecting to was using a RapidSSL certificate, who has been\nverified by GeoTrust. You want to grab their certificates base64 encoded in PEM\nformat. Stick them all in a ca.crt file.\nHow do we get XMLRPC::Client to actually use that information without hacking\nit all to pieces? Net::HTTP has a few methods that allow you to set the\nappropriate connection settings and XMLRPC::Client uses Net::HTTP. If\nXMLRPC::Client allowed to you specify this directly somehow I would've been a\nlot happier.\nHere's that code snippet again, this time forcing certificate verification with\nthe ca.crt file. This code assumes that the ca.crt file lives in the same\ndirectory as the connection script:\nrequire 'xmlrpc/client'\n\nclass APIConnection\n  def initialize(username, password, host)\n    # Build the arguments for the XMLRPC::Client object\n    conn_args = {\n      :user =&gt; username,\n      :password =&gt; password,\n      :host =&gt; host,\n      :use_ssl =&gt; true,\n      :path =&gt; '/api'\n    }\n\n    @connection = XMLRPC::Client.new_from_hash(conn_args)\n\n    @connection.instance_variable_get('@http').verify_mode = OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER\n    @connection.instance_variable_get('@http').ca_file = File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'ca.crt')\n  end\n\n  def version\n    @connection.call('version')\n  end\nend\n\nThose last two lines in the initialize method first dive into the connection\nwe've already setup (but before it's been called), grab the of Net::HTTP and\ntells it to force peer verification and to use the certificate file we created\nbefore. No more warning, and we're actually safe.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2012/rubys-xmlrpc-client-and-ssl/","title":"Ruby's XMLRPC::Client and SSL"},"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2012/security-through-obesity/":{"body":"Jeremy Spilman recently proposed changes to how user's hashes are stored\nin website's and companies databases. This post was originally going to look at\nsome of the issues involved in the scheme he envisioned, however, he rather\nquickly posted a followup article with a well thought out solution that\ncountered all of the issues that other people and myself were able to come up\nwith. I'd strongly recommend reading both if you haven't done so. Instead of\nannouncing flaws, I'm turning this into a post with a simple functional\nimplementation of the described scheme in Ruby using DataMapper.\nAt first I'd like to point out that this is one of those few examples where a\nform of security through obscurity is actually increasing not only the\nperceived security but the cost to attack a system as well.\nPlease note this code is a minimal, functional, example and should not be used\nin production.

Raw scrypt'd hashes are 256 bits long or 64 hex characters long,\nwhile the salts are 64 bits (16 hex characters) plus some meta-data totaling 25\nhex characters in this example.\nSalts are hashes are computed by the 'scrypt' gem. In this example I've bumped\nup the max time option to create a hash from the default of 0.2 seconds up to 1\nsecond. This is one of those things that I could have left out as the default\nis fine for an example, but it also couldn't hurt slightly increasing it in\ncase someone did copy-paste this into production.\nThe one thing that I'd like to point out is a couple of 'puts' statements I\ndropped in the check_password method on the User model. The first one simply\nannounces an invalid password. A lot of these could indicate a brute force\nattack. The second one is more serious, it indicates that there is either a bug\nin the code, a hash collision has occurred, or an attacker has been able to\ndrop in hash of their choosing into the site_hashes table, but haven't updated\nthe verification hash on the user model yet. I'd strongly recommend reading\nthrough both of Jeremy's posts if you want to understand how this threat works\nand specifically the second post to see how the verification hash protects what\nit does.\nSo how would you use this code? Well you'd want to create a user with a\npassword and then check if their password is valid or not later on like so:\nUser.create(:username =&gt; 'admin', :password =&gt; 'admin')\nUser.first(:username =&gt; 'admin').check_password('admin')\n\nOne of the key ways this separation increases the security of real users hashes\nis by having a large number of fake hashes in the hash table that the attackers\nwill have to crack at the same time. As a bonus I've written a module to handle\njust that for the code I've already provided. Once again this is licensed under\nthe MIT license and should not be considered production ready.\n# This is the code above, you can also include everything below\n# this in the same file if you're into that sort of thing\nrequire 'user_hash_example'\n\nmodule HashFaker\n  def self.fast_hash\n    SiteHash.create(:crypt_hash =&gt; get_bytes(32))\n  end\n\n  def self.hash\n    SiteHash.create(:crypt_hash =&gt; scrypt_helper(get_bytes(24), generate_salt))\n  end\n\n  def self.generate_hashes(count = 5000, fast = false)\n    count.times { fast ? fast_hash : hash }\n  end\n\n  private\n\n  def self.generate_salt\n    SCrypt::Engine.generate_salt(:max_time =&gt; 1.0)\n  end\n\n  def self.get_bytes(num)\n    OpenSSL::Random.random_bytes(num).unpack('H*').first\n  end\n\n  def self.scrypt_helper(plaintext_password, salt)\n    SCrypt::Engine.scrypt(plaintext_password, salt, SCrypt::Engine.autodetect_cost(salt), 32).unpack('H*').first\n  end\nend\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2012/security-through-obesity/","title":"Security Through Obesity"},"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2012/thoughts-on-ipv6-security-and-mitigation/":{"body":"I setup IPv6 on my home network with an OpenWRT router and Hurricane Electric\nand now I suddenly have an opinion on the state of IPv6 security. This is\nsomething that I've been meaning to do for some time and have been mulling over\nin the back of my mind. I'll go over the details from start to finish of\nsetting up hurricane electric on the router in another post as the information\nto do so is very scattered and disjointed. It does appear to be very well\ndocumented on the OpenWRT wiki but I found that they leave out some very\nimportant steps, so stay tuned for that.\nLets start with the loss of NAT. NAT was never intended to be a security\nmeasure and lots of people will argue with me for saying that it was. However,\nthe truth of the matter is that any machine that is behind a NAT is not\ndirectly addressable from the internet without someone on the inside\nintentionally poking holes (even if that someone is a bad-guy).\nAnyone technically knowledgeable enough can usually use fingerprints of how a\nmachine responds to different types of traffic both normal and unusual to\nidentify what operating system, version, and specific details about the\nservices and potential vulnerabilities of that machine. This information is\ninvaluable to attackers.\nOne of IPv6's biggest selling points (and one that I quite enjoy, don't\nmisunderstand this post) is that every device is addressable. This can\npotentially allow attackers to learn more about what they're attacking.\nSo how do you counter this? Well firewalls can help quite a bit in thwarting OS\nfingerprinting, but even the strongest firewall won't completely prevent this.\nAnother, more protective layer that IPv6 gives you for free is it's sheer size.\nDoing a pure enumeration of a single home subnet remotely (that is you are not\non the link IPv6 local link) would take millennia by some estimations, as\nopposed the IPv4 address space which could be done at home in a matter of\nweeks. One house vs the world. That is the scale we are now working at in IPv6.\nThe vast scale, however, while enough to defend against random scans, will not\nprevent your address showing up in server logs that you connect to. A single\nIPv6 address can be scanned just as easily as an IPv4 address.\nWhat's more is that once an attacker has a presence on a subnet they can\nenumerate every single machine on that network in a matter of seconds to\nminutes. Since most home users are infected through drive by trojans, found in\nemails, and websites that the user chooses to go to, and attackers are already\nused to not having direct access to a machine from the internet, means the\nslowness and difficulty of the raw scans just simply won't be an issue.\nDue too the ease of enumerating local networks and that they probably contain\nmore vulnerable machines.... I'll leave that extrapolation as an exercise to my\nreaders. I do predict that infrastructure will become a larger target due to\nthis, just to collect their logs to attack home users.\nThe next thing that I want to bring up is IPv6, by default, uses the\ninterface's MAC address to generate the last 12 characters / 48 bits of the\nIPv6 address. The rest of the local address consists of an identifier\nindicating that the address was generated using a MAC address and was not\nrandomly generated.\nSo what does this actually tell us? Well if the OS and OS version can help up\nspecify attacks, why not the brand and possibly the model of the MAC address?\nWhat attack vectors are waiting in the firmware of our ethernet and wireless\ncards? Firmware that almost never gets updated, and is known to have bugs and\nquirks?\nThat one is actually an easy one, RFC 3041 defines \"Privacy Addresses\". These\nare completely random local addresses that get generated once a day. Logs\nbecome increasingly useless on the server end, there is a lot of decoys on\nnetworks, and we're no longer exposing as much information to potential\nhostiles.\nI use Fedora 17 and it took me a while to figure out how to enable privacy\naddresses the \"Red Hat\" way. You can easily do it generally on any Linux system\nwith sysctl. Just add the following to your /etc/sysctl.conf and reload\nsysctl:\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.use_tempaddr = 2\nnet.ipv6.conf.default.use_tempaddr = 2\n\nBut that isn't the \"Red Hat\" way. Red Hat manages it's interfaces and network\nconfiguration through various interface configuration files living in\n/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts. For any IPv6 enabled interface you can turn\non privacy addresses with the following line for example in\n/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0:\nIPV6_PRIVACY=\"rfc3041\"\n\nAfter restarting your network interfaces they will additionally have privacy\naddresses that will be change automatically. The interfaces still have the MAC\nbased addresses as well but they will not longer be the default and thus will\nnot show up in remote server logs.\nNow, what would be a solid and strong step forward was a way to have a local\nmachine register it's privacy address with a local IDS/IPS with an expiration,\nand to automatically trigger the IDS/IPS whenever a new connection is made to\nan expired privacy address. It would almost be like a free honey pot on your\nown network.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2012/thoughts-on-ipv6-security-and-mitigation/","title":"Thoughts on IPv6 Security and Mitigation"},"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2013/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2013/","title":""},"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2013/access-get-parameters-with-coffeescript/":{"body":"I've been working on a pure javascript based search engine for this static\nwebsite and needed to access a get parameter within the URL.\nI found a few solutions online but they usually made use of jQuery or weren't\nin coffeescript.

To get the emails into the various\ndata stores, I used the ruby script to parse, process and store the emails as\nthey came in.\nIf you're going to be doing any form of mail manipulation or statistics I\nhighly recommend the mail gem. It did almost everything I needed out of\nthe box, though it didn't correctly enumerate any of the additional headers.\nProcmail is a highly flexible mail filtering and local delivery agent. Without\nmuch effort you can pass the mail it is handling through a series of filters\nwhich can manipulate and reject mail before eventually delivering it to your\ninbox. In light of this, we're going to make a filter that simply counts the\ntotal number of emails the script has processed, and add a header to the\nmessage that indicates this count.\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby\n\nrequire 'mail'\n\n# Get the email message from STDIN or a passed filename\nmessage = \"\"\nwhile input = ARGF.gets\n  message += input\nend\n\n# Parse the email into a ruby object\nmsg = Mail.new(message)\n\n# Location of our count file\ncount_file = \"#{ENV['HOME']}/.mail_counter.txt\"\n\n# Load or initialize our count value and increment it\ncount = File.exists?(count_file) ? File.read(count_file).to_i : 0\ncount += 1\n\n# Update our count on disk\nFile.write(count_file, count.to_s)\n\n# Add our header with the count\nmsg.header.fields &lt;&lt; Mail::Field.new(\"X-Mail-Counter: #{count}\")\n\n# Output the now modified message back out to $stdout\nbegin\n  $stdout.puts msg.to_s\nrescue Errno::EPIPE\n  exit(74)\nend\n\nMake sure you mark the script executable after saving it.\nIf you followed along with my earlier post the only change we need to make\nis to add our ruby mail processor as a procmail filter. I've stored the script\nin ~/.bin/mail-counter.rb, if you've stored it in a different location you'll\nwant to update your path to reflect that.\nFilters in procmail are handled by using the pipe helper. The following is a\nminimum working example of a procmailrc file to make use of our filter:\nMAILDIR=$HOME\nVERBOSE=on\n\n:0fw\n| /home/sstelfox/Documents/ruby/riak-mail-indexer/counter.rb\n\n:0\nMaildir/\n\nStore the above file in ~/.procmailrc. The next time you run fetchmail\nthose headers will be added to the messages before being delivered and you can\nwatch the count increment by looking at the contents of ~/.mail_counter.txt.\nThe following are a few additional sources I made use of while writing this\narticle:\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/273262/best-practices-with-stdin-in-ruby\nhttp://www.jstorimer.com/blogs/workingwithcode/7766125-writing-ruby-scripts-that-respect-pipelines\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2013/running-emails-through-ruby/","title":"Running Emails Through Ruby"},"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2013/taking-back-the-sky/":{"body":"During my daily review of various new sources I came across one particular\narticle that was both concerning and very amusing.

This update didn't fix the branding (and I'd love to remove the Dell\nbranding as it's kind of annoying) it did, however, fix a number of other\nissues that I was experiencing such as:\n\nConsole Redirection failing to connect\nBMC losing it's network connection after a couple of minutes\nSlow responses, with occasional failures to load pages\nRemote IPMI tools being unable to read sensors status\n\nThe first step is too download the latest version of of the BMC software from\nDell's support site (I've also taken the liberty of hosting a copy\nmyself). I recommend you go through the process of entering the service tag\nof each of the blades and make sure that Dell recognizes them as existing even\nif they're out of support.\nThere has been mention of versions of these blades that had custom\nmodifications for DCS and any attempts to modify the BIOS or BMC will likely\ncause you to end up bricking the remote management board or the motherboard.\nEven with the regular board there is always a risk of bricking it, though\nfirmware updates have gotten a lot more reliable and I haven't experienced an\nincorrectly flashed motherboard in years. You've been warned.\nThe BMC was fairly straight forward. I installed the 64-bit version of Fedora\n19 on a thumb drive, downloaded version 1.30 of the BMC software (get the file\nnamed PEC6100BMC130.exe). The file itself is a self-extracting zip archive\nwhich can be extracted using the regular unzip utility.\nunzip PEC6100BMC130.exe\n\nInside you'll find two folders, KCSFlash and SOCFlash should both be put on the\nlive drive within the KCSFlash. You'll need to set the execute bit on the\ncontents of the linux directory and the linux.sh file. You'll also need to\ninstall the glibc.i686 package. Afterwards it's as simple as booting each\nchassis off the drive and as root run the linux.sh script.\nIf the KCSFlash fails, the SOCFlash will more likely than not work but it is\nslightly more dangerous. If you need it mark the linux/flash8.sh,\nlinux/socflash, and linux/socflash_x64 as executable in the SOCFlash folder\nand run the flash8.sh script.\nAfter that you're going to want to reboot into the BIOS and ensure the IPMI\nethernet port is set to dedicated, as this switched it back to \"Shared\" on me.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2013/updating-bmc-on-dell-poweredge-c6100/","title":"Updating BMC on Dell PowerEdge C6100"},"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2013/updating-the-bios-on-dell-poweredge-c6100/":{"body":"The BIOS was quite a bit more complicated and there was a few options that I\nhad available to try, all of which require either Windows or DOS environments.\nI don't have any legal copies of Windows to put on my server and didn't want to\ngo through all that effort.\nIt really needs to be done within a DOS environment.

While\nlooking for alternatives I found out that dnsmasq has a built-in read-only\nTFTP server.\nI already have a DNS and DHCP server on my network and didn't want dnsmasq to\ntake on either of those roles so my first challenge was finding a way to\nprevent dnsmasq from running those bits of it's code, or failing that I would\njust firewall off the service.

Everything from web\nservices that are quite solid and respectable, to native desktop apps.\nA lot of these are simply too heavy for me, involve installing software on a\ncomputer to access in addition to sharing the file around, or required you to\nremember multiple account details before you could get access to any individual\npassword.\nDue too the various complexities and lack of matching use cases a couple years\nago I set out to develop my own open-source version of PassPack. In the interim\nthough I needed a solution for keeping track of my hundreds of various accounts\nand their passwords.\nAround this time I was ramping up my usage of vim and happened to come across a\nvery fortunate command entirely by accident. Enter vimcrypt.\nFor any plaintext file you, while in command mode you can type the command :X\nand it will ask you for a password to encrypt your file with. By default this\nuses a remarkably weak algorithm called pkzip which isn't secure enough\nfor me to trust it with my keys.\nSince vim 7.3 and later, :X has also supported an additional cipher; The much\nstronger blowfish algorithm. You can enable this by running the command :set cryptmethod=blowfish. I chose to add the following lines to my ~/.vimrc\nfile:\n\" When encrypting any file, use the much stronger blowfish algorithm\nset cryptmethod=blowfish\n\nThis was a fantastic interim solution as I have yet to find a development or\nproduction linux system that hasn't been excessively locked down (and probably\nnot somewhere I'd put my password file anyway) that didn't already have vim\ninstalled.\nUsing this personally required me coming up with a pseudo-file format that\nwould allow me to quickly and easily find the credentials I needed. I settled\non the simple format shown off below:\nOneline Account Description\n  Site: &lt;URL of Site's login page&gt;\n  Username: &lt;username for the site&gt;\n  Password: &lt;password for the site&gt;\n  Email: &lt;email I used to register&gt;\n\n  Login with: &lt;email|username&gt; # Only necessary when I have both\n\n  ** Address on file **\n  ** Phone on file **\n\nYou'll notice I also used this to keep track of whether an account had physical\ninformation tied to it. When I moved this made it very quick for me to search\nfor accounts that I needed to update with my new mailing address.\nAs with many solutions this \"temporary\" one became more and more permanent as\nmy motivation to build the Passpack competitor dwindled. My problem had been\nsolved and I was no longer compelled to put any effort into a solution.\nIf this still isn't strong enough for your tastes, the vim wiki has some\nadditional ways you can encrypt your files. These all require additional setup\nand failed my requirements in that they generally require additional files or\nsetup before I can access my passwords.\nHope this helps some other weary CLI warrior some trouble. Cheers!\nUpdate: I received a recommendation from a user named sigzero over\non Reddit. For additional security they added the following line to their\n~/.vimrc file.\nautocmd BufReadPost * if &amp;key != \"\" | set noswapfile nowritebackup viminfo= nobackup noshelltemp history=0 secure | endif\n\nIt disables additional files that vim may write copies to such as swap files\nand backups, prevents dangerous shell commands, and prevents vim from storing a\nhistory of commands.\nUpdate 2: I received another recommendation from another reddit user,\nthis time from NinlyOne.  At their recommendation, I've prepended the\nfollowing modeline to my password.  It automatically folds each password entry\nto prevent potential shoulder surfing. You can open up an entry using the\ncommand zo and close it back up with zc.

In the past I've never had to worry about identification\nor presentation of these keys. Normally I've only got one too three pairs at\nmost that I'm manipulating (server, certificate authority, client).\nI've not found myself working on a project that involves presenting the\ncertificates to users for selection and comparison. The obvious way too do this\nis take a page out of other developer's books and present the key's\nfingerprint.\nFor those unfamiliar with key fingerprints, they are a condensed way to compare\ndiffering RSA with a high probability that if the fingerprints match, so do the\nkeys. These are generally based on a cryptographic digest function such as SHA1\nand MD5, and you'll see them most commonly when connecting to a new SSH host\nand will look like the following:.\nThe authenticity of host 'some.fakedomain.tld (127.0.0.1)' can't be established.\nRSA key fingerprint is 0c:6c:dd:32:b5:59:40:1d:ac:05:24:4f:04:bc:e0:f3.\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?\n\nThe string of 32 hex characters presented there can be compared with another\nknown value to make sure you're connecting to the correct SSH server and will\nalways be the same length regardless of the bit-strength of the keys used.\nWithout the fingerprint, users would have to compare 256 hex characters for a\n1024 bit key, which is a very low security key.\nYou can calculate the SSH fingerprint for your SSH key or a SSH host key using\nthe ssh-keygen command like so:\nssh-keygen -lf ~/.ssh/id_rsa\nssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key.pub\n\nIt will work when the path is either a private RSA key or a public key\nformatted for SSH authorized key files.\nX509 certificates also use a key fingerprint to help identify a certificate's\nsigning authority. What I rapidly learned through this investigation was that\nthey are calculated slightly differently from SSH fingerprints even if they're\nin the same format.\nI couldn't find any good Ruby code that calculated either, and the alternatives\nwere some dense C++. Luckily SSH fingerprints are pretty documented in\nRFC4253 and RFC4716. Fingerprints on RSA keys for use with OpenSSL\nare less clear, and there is a different method for calculating the\nfingerprints of certificates.\nSlowly working through the undocumented bits of Ruby's OpenSSL wrapper, the\nRFCs and a couple of C++ implementations I finally got a set of working\nimplementations that calculate the following fingerprints in Ruby:\n\nMD5 &amp; SHA1 fingerprints for RSA SSH keys\nFingerprints of RSA keys for use with x509 certificates\nFingerprints of x509 certificates\n\nThe easiest being a regular x509 certificate:\nrequire 'openssl'\n\npath_to_cert = '/tmp/sample.crt'\ncert = OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new(File.read(path_to_cert))\nputs OpenSSL::Digest::SHA1.hexdigest(cert.to_der).scan(/../).join(':')\n\nYou can compare the output of the above code with OpenSSL's implementation with\nthe following command:\nopenssl x509 -in /tmp/sample.crt -noout -fingerprint\n\nPlease note that case sensitivity doesn't matter here (OpenSSL will return\nupper case hex codes).\nThe next one I got working was the SSH fingerprints thanks to the RFCs mentioned\nearlier.\nrequire 'openssl'\n\npath_to_key = '/tmp/ssh_key'\n\nkey = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.new(File.read(path_to_key))\ndata_string = [7].pack('N') + 'ssh-rsa' + key.public_key.e.to_s(0) + key.public_key.n.to_s(0)\nputs OpenSSL::Digest::MD5.hexdigest(data_string).scan(/../).join(':')\n\nPlease note: The above only works for RSA SSH keys.\nCalculating a SHA1 fingerprint for SSH hosts is as simple as replacing the\n'MD5' class with 'SHA1' or any of the other support digest algorithms.\nThe last one was the hardest to track down and implement, eventually I found\nthe answer in RFC3279 under section 2.3.1 for the format of the public key\nI would need to generate before performing a digest calculation on it.\nrequire 'openssl'\n\npath_to_key = '/tmp/x509_key.pem'\n\nkey = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.new(File.read(path_to_key))\ndata_string = OpenSSL::ASN1::Sequence([\n  OpenSSL::ASN1::Integer.new(key.public_key.n),\n  OpenSSL::ASN1::Integer.new(key.public_key.e)\n])\nputs OpenSSL::Digest::SHA1.hexdigest(data_string.to_der).scan(/../).join(':')\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2014/calculating-rsa-key-fingerprints-in-ruby/","title":"Calculating RSA Key Fingerprints in Ruby"},"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2014/chain-loading-kernels/":{"body":"I've found several places where I needed to be able to update my kernels but\nfor one reason or another can't update the kernel that gets booted initially. A\ncouple of these situations were:\n\nRunning Custom or Updated Kernels on DigitalOcean (this is one of their\nbiggest failings IMHO)\nAllowing updating of kernels on embedded linux devices that require their\nkernel flashed into NVRAM.\nRunning an embedded system that used an active/backup partition scheme for\nupdating.\n\nIn all cases the process was pretty much the same, though there were some\ncustom changes to the preliminary init system depending on what I needed to get\ndone, especially with the last one which I may cover in a different article.\nIn all cases these were done on a Red Hat based distribution like CentOS,\nScientific Linux, RHEL, or even Fedora. For those users of Debian based systems\nyou'll need to adjust the scripts too your system though I can't imagine\nanything other than the package names changing.\nThis assumes you already have the kernel and initramfs you want to boot\ninstalled on your local filesystem at /boot/vmlinuz-custom and\n/boot/initramfs.img.\nA quick background on how this works, when the linux kernel is compiled an init\nprogram is configured to be the first thing triggered, by default and in most\nsituations this will be the executable /sbin/init. This init process is then\nresponsible for starting the rest of the daemons and processes that make up the\nsystems we regularly interact with.\nThere are tools that allow you too effectively execute another kernel to run in\nplace of the kernel that is already running. There are some catches though as\nthe new kernel won't always re-initialize all devices (since they've already\nbeen initialized) and that can lead too some weird behaviors with processes\nthat already have hooks on those devices.\nToo prevent any issues you need to load the new kernel as early in the boot\nprocess as possible. Doing this in the init program is pretty much as early as\nyou can get and makes for a pretty stable system (I've yet to experience any\nissues with machines running this way).\nThere are several different init systems and they all behave a little\ndifferently, as far as I know only systemd supports a means of automatically\nexecuting a different kernel but I am personally not a systemd fan and it would\nbe too late in the boot process already for me too trust the chain load. You\ncan reliably chain load kernels regardless of what your normal init system is\nthough very easily and that's what I'm going to cover here.\nYou'll need to have the kexec tools installed on your system. This is pretty\nstraight-forward:\nyum install kexec-tools -y\n\nNext we're going to shift the standard init process off to the side, someplace\nstill accessible so we can call it later (this will need to be done as root).\nmv /sbin/init /sbin/init.original\n\nNow we need to create our own init script that will handle detecting if it's\nthe new or old kernel, replacing the kernel if it is indeed an old one, and\nstarting up the normal init process if it's the new kernel.\nNow there is a very important catch here, whatever process starts up first is\ngiven PID 1 which is very important in kernel land. Whatever process is PID 1\nwill inherit all zombie processes on the system and will need to handle them.\nSince our shell script is the first thing started up it will get PID 1 for both\nthe old and new kernel and getting the process handling code correct is not a\ntrivial issue.\nWhat we really need is to hand over PID 1 to the init process so it can do it's\njob normally as if the shell script never existed. There is a native function\nto do exactly this in these shell scripts: exec.\nOur simple shell script to do the chain load looks like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Detect if this is the old kernel (not booted with the otherwise meaningless\n# 'kexeced' parameter.\nif [ $(grep -q ' kexeced$' /proc/cmdline) ]; then\n  kexec --load /boot/vmlinuz-custom --initrd=/boot/initramfs.img \\\n    --reuse-cmdline --append=' kexeced'\n  kexec --exec\nfi\n\n# If we made it this far we're running on the new kernel, trigger the original\n# init binary with all the options passed too this as well as having it take\n# over this process's PID.\nexec /sbin/init.original \"$@\"\n\nAfter rebooting you should be in your new kernel which you can verify with\nuname -a and also by examining the /proc/cmdline file for the existence of\nthe kexeced flag.\nIf you modify the script above, be very careful as any execution error will\ncause your system to die and recovery will only be possible by mounting the\nfilesystem on another linux system and fixing it.\nIn a future article I'll cover how to use this trick to build an active /\nbackup system allowing you to fall back to a known good system when booting\nfails which is incredibly useful for embedded devices in the field that need\nupdates but are not easy to get too or replace when an update bricks the\nsystem.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2014/chain-loading-kernels/","title":"Chain Loading Kernels"},"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2014/creating-crypt-style-sha512-passwords-with-ruby/":{"body":"I needed to generate crypt-style SHA512 passwords in ruby for an /etc/shadow\nfile.

After\nthinking about this for a while I settled on a good old friend of mine,\nObjectSpace.\nFor those not familiar with the ObjectSpace module, it is a means to inspect\nand access the items being tracked by Ruby's garbage collector. This means it\nhas a hook into every living object, and more dangerously, every near-death\nobject.\nObjectSpace provides a method for enumerating instances of a specific class,\nspecifically named each_object which takes a class. With Ruby all classes are\nin fact instances of the Class class. This allows us to enumerate every\navailable class by passing it to the enumerator like so:\nObjectSpace.each_object(Class).to_a\n\nAlright so we now have an array of every single class that could possibly be\ninstantiated, how do we narrow it down to just the ones we're interested in?\nOnce again Ruby provides with the ancestors method, combine that with a\nselect and we can quickly narrow it down. You can see it in the following\nexample:\n[1] pry(main)&gt; TargetSubclass = Class.new(String)\n=&gt; TargetSubclass\n[2] pry(main)&gt; ObjectSpace.each_object(Class).select { |k| k.ancestors.include?(String) }\n=&gt; [String, TargetSubclass]\n\nHmm, that's not quite right though. We have found all the subclasses but we've\nalso grabbed the parent class. With one small modification we eliminate that as\nwell.\n[1] pry(main)&gt; TargetSubclass = Class.new(String)\n=&gt; TargetSubclass\n[2] pry(main)&gt; ObjectSpace.each_object(Class).select { |k| k.ancestors.include?(String) &amp;&amp; k != String }\n=&gt; [TargetSubclass]\n\nThat line is rather long though, and I generally like to avoid multiple tests\nin a select block. There is a tad bit of syntactic sugar provided by Ruby\nallowing us to accomplish the same thing, our final example is ultimately the\nsolution I went with:\n[1] pry(main)&gt; TargetSubclass = Class.new(String)\n=&gt; TargetSubclass\n[2] pry(main)&gt; ObjectSpace.each_object(Class).select { |k| k &lt; String }\n=&gt; [TargetSubclass]\n\nPutting this into a method:\ndef subclasses(klass)\n  ObjectSpace.each_object(Class).select { |k| k &lt; klass }\nend\n\nIf you were so inclined you could extend the Class class with a method to\nmake this available anywhere like so:\nclass Class\n  def self.subclasses\n    ObjectSpace.each_object(Class).select { |k| k &lt; self }\n  end\nend\n\nI'm personally not a fan of extending any of the core classes unless absolutely\nnecessary, but too each there own.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2014/finding-ruby-subclasses/","title":"Finding Ruby Subclasses"},"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2014/fixing-erratic-bmc-controller-on-poweredge-c6100/":{"body":"I randomly started experiencing an issue with one blade in one of my PowerEdge\nC6100 blades.

This hack\nis potentially dangerous and should absolutely only be done in development\nenvironments. This won't affect your host system, only the docker container so\nthe most damage you'll do is prevent hostname and possibly user/group lookups\nwithin the container itself.\nAlright with that out of the way, I was actively working on a codebase that\nuses subdomains as part of the identifier. Rather than setup a full DNS server,\npoint my local system at it and load in the domains I wanted to simply modify\nthe /etc/hosts file inside the environment.\nDocker mounts an /etc/hosts file inside it's containers, read-only, and the\ncontainer's 'root' user has had it's mount permissions revoked so it's not able\nto be modified. Other users have encountered this issue, and a novel\nworkaround was put forward. The solution however makes use of Perl, and is\nspecific too Ubuntu base systems.\nI'll explain the solution after showing a more general way to accomplish the\nsame thing. Different linux systems will store their libraries in different\ndirectory structures. CentOS is different from Fedora, which is different from\nUbuntu and Debian. All of them name their libraries, in this case we're looking\nfor 'libnss_files.so.2'.\nYou can find where your copy of this library lives with the following command.\nThis should be run inside the docker container that you want to modify the\n/etc/hosts file in.\nfind / -name libnss_files.so.2 -print 2&gt; /dev/null\n\nPay attention to the path, multiple files may show up and you want the one that\nmatches your system's running kernel (generally x86_64 systems will have their\nlibraries in a lib64 directory).\nOnce you've found this add the following lines to your Dockerfile. Make sure\nyou modify the path in the copy in the first line to the path of your copy of\nthe library. Once done you'll use the /var/hosts file to modify your hosts file\ninstead.\nRUN mkdir -p /override_lib &amp;&amp; cp /etc/hosts /var/ &amp;&amp; cp /usr/lib64/libnss_files.so.2 /override_lib\nRUN sed -ie 's:/etc/hosts:/var/hosts:g' /override_lib/libnss_files.so.2\nENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH /override_lib\n\nSo what is this actually doing? On linux systems, name configurations such as\nDNS, username, and group lookups are generally handled by the nss or name\nservice switch configuration tools including the hosts file. The library that\nwe're copying and modifying is a very specific to reading from files on the\nsystem and includes the default paths to these files.\nGenerally you have to be very careful when you're manipulating strings within\ncompiled libraries. The length of the string is encoded along with it, so at a\nminimum it's important that the string is the same length or less. You can\nget away with less but it requires additionally writing an end of string\ncharacter as well.\nToo make this hack simple, we're simply replacing the 'etc' with 'var', both\nsystems directories that regular users generally should have read access but\nnot write access too.\nFinally we need to tell all programs that need to perform lookups using\nhostnames in the hosts file to make use of our modified library instead of the\nsystem one. Linux will look for shared libraries at runtime in any paths set in\nin the LD_LIBRARY_PATH (colon delimited just like PATH) and this doesn't\nrequire any privileges too set.\nAnd the result? An editable hosts file, with no extra services. I can't stress\nenough though, there could be bad ramifications from modifying libraries this\nway. This is definitely not a 'production ready' hack.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2014/modifying-the-hosts-file-in-a-docker-container/","title":"Modifying the Hosts File in a Docker Container"},"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2014/one-liner-ssl-certificate-generation/":{"body":"I regularly find myself in need of generating a quick SSL key and certificate\npair.

It would\nspecifically happen when a database had been dropped, recreated and I freshly\nran the migrations.\nIt seems that while Rails 4 supports the HStore datatype, it doesn't enable the\nextension itself. I've found two ways too solve this issue in wildly different\nways.\nFirst Solution: Enable HStore by Default\nThis is the common solution that is recommended too solve this issue. It\nenables the HStore extension by default on all newly created databases. Too\nunderstand this you need to know a bit about PostgreSQL's behavior.\nWhen a new database is created, PostgreSQL creates a copy of a special\npre-existing database named template1 by default. Anything done too this\ndatabase will be reflected in all new databases, including enabling extensions.\nToo enable the HStore extension on the template1 database you can execute the\nfollowing command (generally as the postgres user or with your authentication\nof choice).\npsql -d template1 -c 'CREATE EXTENSION hstore;'\n\nSecond Solution: Rails Migration\nThe above solution doesn't sit well with me. While it's uncommon for any\nindividual PostgreSQL server to be shared among different applications with\ndifferent databases, the possibility is there. Perhaps the application will get\ndecommissioned and the DBA will simply drop the associated database and roles\ninstead of setting up a new one.\nDisconnecting the requirements of the application from the application itself\nalways seems to lead too trouble.\nRails already has a mechanism too handle modifications too the database\novertime, migrations. They're solid, well tested, and encapsulate not only how\nto get the database to a particular state but also how to return it back to\nit's prior state (generally).\nWe can also do this without using raw SQL which now also seems a bit... Off to\nme. The following is a sample Rails migration that will both enable and disable\nthe extension:\nclass ManageHstore &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration\n  def change\n    reversible do |op|\n      op.up { enable_extension 'hstore' }\n      op.down { disable_extension 'hstore' }\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nNow the biggest problem with this migration is that too use it, you need too\nplan ahead of time too use the extension or not worry about freshly running all\nthe migrations (generally because you dropped and created the database). This\nmigration needs to be named so it alphabetically comes before any migration in\nyour application that makes use of the HStore datatype.\nActiveRecord uses timestamps at the beginning of the migration names to handle\nthis alphabetic sorting, and such you'll want to fake this in before you used\nthe HStore datatype.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2014/pg-error-error-type-hstore-does-not-exist/","title":"PG::Error: ERROR: Type 'Hstore' Does Not Exist"},"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2014/preventing-tmux-lockups/":{"body":"Anyone that has used SSH, Tmux or Screen for a while will have inevitably\ndumped excessive output to their terminal.

After switching to Route 53 for DNS the authresult component\nstarted showing up as fail for SPF.\nTesting around a few online SPF validators indicated that none of them were\nable to see my new SPF record, and there had been plenty of time for it too\npropagate.\nThe SPF resource record type (RRTYPE 99) is available in Route 53 even though\nthe record type has been deprecated. Not being familiar with this\nparticular decision, I assumed I should be using it instead of the TXT record\nI've used for every other domain, and it would be handled correctly or more\nintelligently.\nSolution: Either switch the SPF record too a TXT record or, my preference,\nduplicate it into a TXT record so you have both.\nInvalid DKIM record\nThis one had me scratching my head for a while. This was my first time\ndeploying DKIM on a domain that I was not running a Bind name server for.\nOpenDKIM is nice enough too generate a Bind record for you which works\nperfectly. It's output looks like the following:\ndefault._domainkey.example.tld.

The catch? This won't be treated\nas a single record, but three individual responses. None of which are complete\nand valid DKIM records.\nThis happens because Route 53's value field treats newlines as separate\nrecords.\nSolution: Turn it into one long string so it isn't covering multiple lines\nright?

After some research the reason behind this is\nclear, and makes sense. Though it is another poor usability bug in the way\nAmazon's Route 53 behaves. Individual DNS UDP packets are limited too 255\ncharacters for their response.\nToo properly deliver records longer than that DNS servers are supposed to break\nup the response into chunks. Properly implemented clients combine these chunks\ntogether (with no spaces, newlines or other characters added). What this means\nis that the record can be broken up transparently behind the scenes anywhere in\nthe message and the client will put it back together correctly.\nThe Route 53 entry form won't handle this for you though, and in hindsight it\nlooks like Bind might not do it for you though I suspected that was more for\nreadability of zone files rather than a technical limitation (and I haven't\ntested whether Bind is intelligent enough too handle just a long string).\nSolution: Take the original output of Bind between the parentheses and just\nremove the newline characters, leave the quotation marks and spaces between the\nsections like the following sample and you'll be golden:\n\"v=DKIM1; k=rsa; t=y; s=email; \" \"p=MIHfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4HNADCByQKBwQC2Cwpa/+Xhfkzn0QnyQoxRwoJPb+s51dIt9UtFLMlMFuYa/k3GBwZ7UWeyAaQJ3RibSzKV/YwgFuMrzyISrLNSuL2k1bQlQQG8nl23Mu9Mowcb+mV2/3G7roshK6kOLNA0IV2SBl8/0UoNZR/x7c1lzVtVqdj0vW1SsJzgGfbt4LGRvCPyjdg+SLpYtOd/Li4Y1pvHgSRKQRrklpKeJo\" \"nJQ4+lXWqzYtuX9xdNH46ck2HUl56Ob4cy3/gYCJBWrAsCAwEAAQ==\"\n\nHope this helps someone else!\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2014/spf-and-dkim-records-in-route-53/","title":"SPF & DKIM Records in Route 53"},"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2014/starting-puppetmaster-on-fedora-19/":{"body":"I was trying to get puppet running out of the box on Fedora 19 and found a bug\nexists in their systemd service file.

For many of them I'm either the sole\nadministrator or one of three or less with administrative access. Where there\nare multiple administrative users, we all are generally working as backups to\neach other. We use sudo whenever we need to execute a task with privileges on\nany of these machines with no direct root login permitted remotely.\nI must confess I have established two habits over time that are against best\npractices with regard to sudo; Using it to execute a root shell only, and not\nrestricting which commands can be run with sudo.\n\nI'm sure many other administrators commit these sins as well. I've always\ngotten sudo to the 'good enough' point without ever learning how to configure\nit properly countless times, which mostly meant leaving the distribution's\ndefaults.\nAt face value, executing a shell this way doesn't seem to pose a problem. We\nuse auditd to record administrative changes, and the kernel can track our\noriginal login UID and record that in addition to our effective user ID.\nPermission to use sudo is still restricted to a subset of trusted\nadministrators.\nUsing this default configuration is forming bad habits and after working\nthrough it it's not particularly hard to make a drastic improvement on the\ngranularity of control.\nI'm going to work through the changes I've made slowly building up my final\nconfiguration.\nThese changes, if made incorrectly or with the wrong paths to binaries may\neffect your ability to get privileged access to the system. I strongly\nencourage you to maintain a root shell independent of the shell you are using\nto test just in case you need to revert a breaking change.\nMinimal Configuration\nRather than looking at what needs to be changed, or removed I prefer to start\nwith a minimal effective configuration.\nMost distribution's default sudo configuration pass through environment\nvariables related to locale and a few others. I have left these out since the\nway I see sudo executed most commonly (sudo su -), removes any environment\nvariables passed through anyway. If you work on multi-lingual systems or\notherwise your administrators make use of multiple system locales, you will\nwant to re-introduce the locale values used.\nMy entire starting sudo configuration is the following:\nDefaults env_reset\nDefaults !visiblepw\n\nroot      ALL=(ALL)     ALL\n%wheel    ALL=(root)    ALL\n\nThis is very similar to most distribution's configurations if you ignore the\nenvironment variables and comments. The root user and members of the wheel\ngroup can all execute anything as sudo as long as the user can authenticate\nthrough PAM and the mechanism won't display their password.\nThere is also a small restriction in place that ensures members of the wheel\ngroup will only be executing commands as the root user. Executing as other\nuser's directly should be a special case and added separately.\nUsually distributions also include additional sudo configuration by including\nall files in /etc/sudoers.d. This configuration isn't going to be terribly long\nso we may as well KISS it and not allow the inclusion of other files.\nNo Need for the su\nThe first habit I wanted to break was executing sudo su - instead of sudo -s. Generally when sudo is configured correctly, administrators are supposed\nto minimize the number of times dropping to a root shell. There are always\ngoing to be times when a root shell is necessary.\nThe differences between the two methods of executing a root shell are subtle.\nThey are creating to different types of shells. Executing sudo su - creates\na login shell, while sudo -s doesn't. Both can be subtly changed to provide\nthe other type (Adding the -i flag to sudo, or removing the - from su).\nA login shell resets your environment, spawns the new user's default shell (in\nthis case root's default shell) and executes the user's profile scripts in\naddition to the shell's rc files.\nBy not using a login shell, administrators can keep their preferred shells\nwhile allowing selective bits of their configuration (whitelisted environment\nvariables) through to the new session.\nBy removing su from the process, administrators can enforce permitted root\nshells just like whitelisting or blacklisting any other binary on the system.\nThe only way to enforce this transition is to blacklist su directly.\nA blacklist is added by creating a command alias that includes the commands to\nbe blacklisted, then adjusting ACLs to make use of them. These need to be\ndefined before they're used. Generally this means all command aliases are at\nthe top of the configuration file. The following command alias will be used for our\nblacklist. The path to su is valid for CentOS 7, other distributions do\nvary.\nCmnd_Alias BLACKLIST = /bin/su\n\nTo enforce the blacklist the wheel group ACL needs to be adjusted to the\nfollowing:\n%wheel  ALL=(root)  ALL,!BLACKLIST\n\nNow when you try to execute sudo su - you'll instead get this warning after\nauthenticating:\nSorry, user &lt;username&gt; is not allowed to execute '/bin/su -' as root on &lt;hostname&gt;.\n\nThis warning will enforce not using the less ideal mechanism.\nBrief Interlude on Blacklists\nI'm going to be adding several more things to different forms of blacklists\ninside sudo. Some of these may be unacceptably inconvenient for some\nenvironments. If you find the explained reason insufficient to justify the\ninconvenience and are willing to accept the risk, remove the offender from the\nblacklist.\nThere is also always a risk that programs allowed through the blacklist have\nthe ability to execute blacklisted applications as root. The blacklist applies\nonly to direct execution through sudo.\nPreventing 'commonly used' escalation vectors does make it that much harder on\npotential attackers and may allow you see an attack in progress through the\nlogs. This should not be considered perfect though. A good example of these\nvectors is the utility awk. If allowed to be executed through sudo an\nunrestricted root shell can be acquired with the following command:\nsudo awk 'BEGIN {system(\"/bin/sh\")}'\n\nEditing Files as Root\nCommonly when I wanted to edit a particular sensitive configuration file, I\nwould drop to a root shell, then open the file in my preferred editor, possibly\nsaving along the way until I was done. Less commonly I would open my editor\ndirectly using sudo skipping the shell entirely.\nThe partially complete saves as part of that workflow, have caused issues\nthough they're temporary. Sudo provides a utility, sudoedit, that covers this\nuse case. It make a copy of the file to be edited into a temporary directory,\nand allows you to edit and save as you like. When you're done save the file and\nit will replace the real file with the temporary one you've been editing.\nEditing the sudoers file itself should be done using the visudo command. And\ncan be invoked by:\nsudo visudo\n\nIt's a good idea to restrict the list of editors that can be used by visudo\n(this doesn't affect sudoedit at all) by adding the following line (replace\nthis with your preferred, colon separated list of editors):\nDefaults editor = /bin/vim:/bin/nano\n\nUser Writable Directories\nSince the blacklist functionality is based on full paths to binaries, there is\na quick way for a user with sudo permissions to bypass the blacklist for a\nspecific program, copy it somewhere else.\nWhen an attacker gets into a system and downloads a binary off their site they\nwant to run with privileges. They'll have to put it somewhere they have\npermission to write to.\nThis is less of a threat if you always require authentication to use sudo,\ntrust all your administrators, and are confident their credentials will never\nbe stolen.\nA salve to both problems is simply to prevent sudo from executing files in user\nwritable directories, and ensuring it has a sane path to lookup trusted\nbinaries. The following three lines need to be added to the sudoers file:\nCmnd_Alias USER_WRITEABLE = /home/*, /tmp/*, /var/tmp/*\nDefaults ignore_dot\nDefaults secure_path = /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin\n\nWe also need to modify our wheel ACL to prevent the execution in the aliases\nlocations. Replace your previous line with the following one:\n%wheel  ALL=(root)  ALL,!BLACKLIST,!USER_WRITEABLE\n\nPreventing Breakouts\nI've already shown that there is a way to abuse individual commands to expose a\nroot shell. There are a few additional common applications that can regularly\nshell out, advanced text editors, pagers, several unix utilities and any\ninteractive programming shell are easy candidates.\nThese utilities likely still need to be available for general administrative\npurposes, but we don't want them in turn executing other programs. Sudo has a\ntrick up it's sleeve for this, the noexec flag.\nThere are two ways to effectively apply this, a whitelist and a blacklist. I\nencourage you to try the whitelist approach first as it does offer\nsubstantially better protection against this potential abuse.\nBefore applying this it is useful to know how this works and what it's\nlimitations are. Sudo disables the exec call using LD_PRELOAD and defining an\nalternate version of the system call. This is largely effective, but will only\nwork with dynamically linked programs (most coming from a distribution are\ngoing to be dynamically linked).\nWhitelisting Programs w/ Exec Privileges\nThis is very strict but also very effective. We need to ensure that things we\nexpect and want to be able to execute other programs (like shells) still can.\nAdditionally visudo in turn executes your editor, so it to needs to be able to\nspawn programs.\nBe very sure of the paths in the following change. If you have no shells, or\neditors that can be executed as root through sudo you may lock yourself out of\nyour system privileges.\nCmnd_Alias SHELLS = /bin/sh, /bin/bash\nCmnd_Alias ALLOWED_EXEC = /usr/sbin/visudo\nDefaults noexec\nDefaults!ALLOWED_EXEC,SHELLS !noexec\n\nAs you use this in your environment you will probably find programs that behave\nincorrectly and will need to be added to the whitelist. This whitelist\n(assuming your paths are correct) will at least be enough to allow future\nmodifications of the sudoers file.\nBlacklisting Programs w/ Exec Privileges\nThis is a much milder version of the exec restrictions, and won't catch unknown\nabuses. This will also have the least impact on normal operations to apply and\nis better than nothing.\nCmnd_Alias EDITORS     = /bin/vim\nCmnd_Alias PAGERS      = /bin/less, /bin/more\nCmnd_Alias BREAKOUT    = /bin/awk, /bin/find\nCmnd_Alias DEVEL_SHELL = /bin/perl, /bin/python, /bin/ruby\n\nDefaults!EDITORS,PAGERS,BREAKOUT,DEVEL_SHELL noexec\n\nTTYs!\nEnforcing the use of TTYs generally prevents non-interactive processes from\nexecuting anything as sudo either remotely or locally. Examples of this might\nbe from cron, apache, or from a remote Jenkins server. In almost all cases\nprevention of this type of execution is the ideal behavior.\nThere are a couple of very visible search results on this topic that\nindicate there isn't any security benefit to this, but their are\nexceptions as well. The argument that seems to have the most merit, is\nthat no special privileges are required to create a PTY. This in turn means an\nattacking process could spawn the PTY required, and continue it's attack.\nThe same argument could be used in favor of the option. An attacker would have\nlearn they need to make this adjustment and actively work around it. As the\nadministrator you know the option is set and should be able to work around it\nmore easily than the attacker.\nThe most common form of pain seems to be remotely executing privileged commands\nthrough ssh. By providing the SSH command being executed the '-t' flag twice,\nthe client will force a PTY allocation even when there is no local tty. Other\nmore stubborn use cases can be individually exempted.\nWhen the user already has a local TTY, the sudoers man page calls out to an\nadditional potential attack vector around TTYs under the 'use_pty' option:\n\nA malicious program run under sudo could conceivably fork a background\nprocess that retains to the user's terminal device after the main program has\nfinished executing. Use of this option will make that impossible.\n\nI haven't been able to find any attacks that exploit this possibility, but I\nhave yet to be impacted by turning that feature on within sudo. Making both\nchanges can be done by adding the following line to the sudoers configuration.\nDefaults requiretty, use_pty\n\nNotification of Violation\nReceiving immediate notification when privilege gain has been attempted can be\ninvaluable to stopping an attacker before they can do any damage. If the linux\nsystem has a properly configured MTA forwarding root's email to relevant\nparties it is recommended to have failure mailed to them directly to take\naction.\nDefaults mail_badpass, mail_no_perms\nDefaults mailfrom = root\nDefaults mailsub = \"Sudo Policy Violation on %H by %u\"\n\nThe overridden subject provides everything but the command itself (which isn't\navailable through the expanded variables) needed to quickly judge a threat at a\nglance.\nAuditing Interactive Shells\nWith all the protections put in place so far, we still have no visibility or\nrestrictions on what administrators do with the root shells when they\nuse them. These should hopefully be relatively few and far between.\nBuilt into sudo is an option to record execution of commands. This has proven\nto be valuable to narrow down things that have gone wrong, or see how something\nwas done before. This may not prove useful as much for an audit tool as a user\nwith root privileges can purge the recordings and logs.\nIf auditing is the goal, use of the kernel audit subsystem may be a better\nchoice, but will only give you the command and arguments executed. This shows\nwhat was displayed to the privileged shell directly. There will be a future\narticle covering the use of the audit subsystem and centralizing the\ninformation in a future post.\nIf you didn't go the whitelist exec route, to enable this you will need to pull\nin the 'SHELLS' command alias from there to make use of this.\nDefaults!SHELLS log_output\n\nOnce this is in place you can get a list of recorded sessions using the\ncommand:\n$ sudo sudoreplay -l\nFeb 26 17:56:18 2016 : jdoe : TTY=/dev/pts/7 ; CWD=/home/jdoe ; USER=root ; TSID=000001 ; COMMAND=/bin/bash\n\nTo view an individual session provide sudoreplay with the TSID value of the\nsession like so:\n$ sudo sudoreplay 000001\n\nRefer to the man page of sudoreplay for additional tricks such as speeding up\nplayback.\nFinal Configuration\nSome of the options from above I have combined into a single configuration\nline. This uses the stricter whitelist policy for exec privileges.\n# /etc/sudoers\n\nCmnd_Alias ALLOWED_EXEC = /usr/sbin/visudo\nCmnd_Alias BLACKLIST = /usr/bin/su\nCmnd_Alias SHELLS = /usr/bin/sh, /usr/bin/bash\nCmnd_Alias USER_WRITEABLE = /home/*, /tmp/*, /var/tmp/*\n\nDefaults env_reset, mail_badpass, mail_no_perms, noexec, requiretty, use_pty\nDefaults !visiblepw\n\nDefaults editor = /usr/bin/vim\nDefaults mailfrom = root\nDefaults mailsub = \"Sudo Policy Violation on %H by %u\"\nDefaults secure_path = /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin\n\nDefaults!ALLOWED_EXEC,SHELLS !noexec\nDefaults!SHELLS log_output\n\nroot    ALL=(ALL)   ALL\n%wheel  ALL=(root)  ALL,!BLACKLIST,!USER_WRITEABLE\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2016/better-practices-with-sudo/","title":"Better Practices With Sudo"},"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2016/hash-cash/":{"body":"This is an interesting proof of work concept.

The issues\nthat need to be worked around largely packaging and profile issues that should\nall be the same.\nI got a hold of a Zynq 7100 development board, and while I've played with some\nembedded ARM microcontrollers such as the STM32F3 series and more basic RISC\nstyle microcontrollers like Atmel's SAMD10 and Atmega lines, I've never played\nwith FPGA development before so I considered this an interesting learning\nopportunity.\nTo do development of the FPGA and generally use the board at all you have to\nshell out $2,995 for a non-transferable license of a proprietary piece of\nsoftware called Vivado to develop on the FPGA. For a hobby project just\nexploring the board this isn't going to fly. There is a 30-day evaluation\nversion though and there are guides to getting it to work in Linux.\nFor this post I'm going to gloss over this part and get to the meat of the\nlargest issue I had while attempting to bootstrap the Linux portion of this\ndevelopment board. Xilinx maintains its own very rough hacked together\ndistribution called PetaLinux which is just a very poorly designed wrapper\naround Yocto Linux.\nUnfortunately I haven't been fully able to remove PetaLinux from my build, I\nstill need to use it to integrate the board specifics with the Linux kernel and\nin turn compile the Linux kernel, u-boot, and handle the configuration to point\nat a root filesystem living on the SD card. PetaLinux's incredibly limited\ndocumentation can at least get you this far. This post covers building that\nroot filesystem and guides around some of the problems the Gentoo cross process\ndoesn't cover.\nI want a target that is a bit more inclusive than most embedded Linux root\nfilesystems (think IoT devices). This device is less constrained than devices\nlike most OpenWRT capable devices (we're not limited to 16MB of space). Let's\nquickly define some criteria that will determine the successful build of a root\nfilesystem:\n\nIt will have all the utilities necessary to support interactive logins\nIt will have a working file editor\nIt will have a valid native compiler for itself\nIt will have a working package manager to allow it to extend itself\n\nFrom this set of goals we will both be able to re-compile everything natively\non the board if we so choose, and get access to the vast majority of packaged\nsoftware from the Gentoo repositories as well as easily perform project\ndevelopment directly.\nTo get started you will have to have a working Gentoo install to start the\ncross compilation from. I've personally had issues with the hardened, SELinux,\nand no-multilib profile variants. If you encounter issues I strongly recommend\ntrying the standard system profile on your build host. I'm also sure there is\nprobably some way to get the portage cross tooling working in other\ndistributions, but I'll leave that as an exercise to the reader.\nTooling\nTo get started we're going to want to setup an overlay specifically for our\ncross development. This will allow customization of the profile for the device\nlater on. This is largely for use beyond this guide and is a good practice to\nseparate changes from your system and the target board.\nThese commands are pretty straight forward and do need to be run as root:\nmkdir -p /usr/local/overlay/portage-crossdev/{profiles,metadata}\necho 'crossdev' &gt; /usr/local/overlay/portage-crossdev/profiles/repo_name\necho 'masters = gentoo' &gt;\n/usr/local/overlay/portage-crossdev/metadata/layout.conf\nchown -R portage:portage /usr/local/overlay/portage-crossdev\n\ncat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; /usr/local/overlay/portage-crossdev/metadata/layout.conf\nmasters = gentoo\nthin-manifests = true\nEOF\n\nmkdir -p /etc/portage/repos.conf\ncat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; /etc/portage/repos.conf/crossdev.conf\n[crossdev]\nlocation = /usr/local/overlay/portage-crossdev\npriority = 10\nmasters = gentoo\nauto-sync = no\nEOF\n\nWith our overlay setup we now need to install the cross development tools (once\nagain as root):\nemerge sys-devel/crossdev\n\nThe next step is to build our initial tool chain. Having worked with many tool\nchains before this is absolutely the easiest time I've ever had setting one up.\nOne command will get you all the way to a C/C++ compiler, linker, bintools, and\na standard library. The specific tool chain target tuple is for a glibc based\ntool chain, on a Xilinx variant of an arm processor (or\narm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi).\ncrossdev --stable -s4 -t arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi\n\nThis will result in a very bare bones root filesystem in\n/usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi. This doesn't really have anything of value\nyet.\nBase System\nWe need to configure portage and then a profile for our build. First off the\nportage configuration, this exists in\n/etc/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi/etc/portage/make.conf and varies slightly from\nthe default.\nCHOST='arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi'\nCBUILD='x86_64-pc-linux-gnu'\nARCH='arm'\n\nHOSTCC='x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-gcc'\n\nCFLAGS='-O2 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer'\nCXXFLAGS=\"${CFLAGS}\"\n\nROOT=\"/usr/${CHOST}/\"\n\nACCEPT_KEYWORDS='arm'\n\nUSE=\"${ARCH}\"\n\nFEATURES='sandbox noman noinfo nodoc'\n\n# Be sure we dont overwrite pkgs from another repo..\nPKGDIR=\"${ROOT}packages/\"\nPORTAGE_TMPDIR=\"${ROOT}tmp/\"\n\nELIBC='glibc'\n\nPKG_CONFIG_PATH=\"${ROOT}usr/lib/pkgconfig/\"\n\nPYTHON_TARGETS='python2_7'\n\nIf you pay attention compared to the defaults there are a few changes I've\nexplicitly made:\n\nDo not build packages, we simply don't need them\nAllow PAM to be included\nReject the testing arm packages (~arm keyword)\nRe-enable the file collision protections between packages\nExplicitly define our valid python target at 2.7 only\n\nThe first three align with my original stated goals, building will be allowed\nand preferred on the device so we won't need to host any packages. We want a\nstandard interactive login and ideally we want a stable system (as much as\npossible). The last one is personal preference as in my build (after this guide\nis over) I'll be using software that doesn't work on Python 3 variants.\nThe fourth change is something I want to draw specific attention to. This is\ndisabled by default because the stock ARM profile is inherently broken. It\nattempts to force both a complete busybox system in addition to the standard\nGentoo base. The faux busybox binaries directly conflict and you'll end up in a\nweird mixed state that isn't good. This is true of libraries as well which will\nresult in some core libraries failing to compile (dev-libs/gmp was the first\none that failed on me).\nTo both fix that issue and allow us to have a clean build, I needed to build a\ncustom Gentoo profile for targeting this device. This minimal profile will work\ncleanly for our target.\nrm /usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi/etc/portage/make.profile\nmkdir /usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi/etc/portage/make.profile\necho 5 &gt; /usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi/etc/portage/make.profile/eabi\ncat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; /usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi/etc/portage/make.profile/parent\n/usr/portage/profiles/base\n/usr/portage/profiles/arch/arm/armv7a\nEOF\n\nmkdir -p /usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords\ncat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; /usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/system\nsys-apps/coreutils ~arm\nsys-apps/sandbox ~arm\nEOF\n\nThere is one final workaround we're going to need to put in place before we can\nbegin compiling our system. Currently sys-apps/portage and\ndev-python/pyxattr are incorrectly packaged and will use the system library\npaths rather than those in the chroot.\nThis prevents both of them from being compiled with native extensions and\nincorrectly places the files inside the chroot (They're in the 64 bit path on a\n32 bit target). This is fixable once we have the root filesystem on the device\nbut in the meantime we need to set some use flags to avoid the issue:\nmkdir -p /usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi/etc/portage/package.use\necho 'sys-apps/portage -native-extensions -xattr' &gt; /usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi/etc/portage/package.use/portage\n\nWith that in place sit back grab a cup of your favorite warm beverage and watch\nthe system compile (seriously this is going to take a hot minute):\narm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi-emerge --update --newuse --deep @system\n\nThere is one final gotcha with the root filesystem, the commands to date will\nnot create several important directories. These can be created with the\nfollowing command:\nmkdir -p /usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi/{dev,home,proc,root,sys}\n\nAt this point you should have a mostly complete root filesystem and may want to\nstart diverging from this guide (but pay attention to the kernel modules\nsection, and the rebuild section). There are a couple of things that won't\ncurrently work, specifically:\n\nAuthentication\nSerial Console\nNetworking\n\nAuthentication &amp; Serial Usage\nFirst authentication, we need to provide root with a password and PAM needs its\nconfiguration files to function. We can't use the native tools (without qemu\nbinary emulation) to change the password so the fastest way to give root a\npassword is to pregenerate a password hash and drop it directly into the\nrelevant files. If you'd like to keep going you can use the hash below for the\nsuper secure password 'root' (I don't recommend it):\nsed -i 's`root:[^:]*:`root:$6$ufWqa3MP$CfFwj0M7tW15gUYBRVms3GG2FJTRMAhlpkwV7Bp4aro6mGFHmotMjHoePNoTd1Gf9fgzh/jJM3rvJgkGgSjz31:`' /usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi/etc/shadow\n\nAnd the requisite PAM configuration files:\narm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi-emerge sys-auth/pambase\n\nThe serial console is going to be more device specific and is a bit tricky to\nfigure out. To find this out on my board I created a service that collected the\nnames of all devices under /dev, logged them to a file and found mine to be\nttyPS0 (also one I've never seen before).\nThe following command will replace the default serial configuration with one\nfor this device (you may also have to change the baud rate it's running at):\nsed -i 's`^s0:.*$`ps0:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty -L 115200 ttyPS0 vt100`' /usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi/etc/inittab\n\nNetworking\narm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi-emerge sys-apps/net-tools net-misc/netifrc \\\n  net-misc/dhcpcd net-misc/iputils sys-apps/iproute2\n\nTo get it to come up by default, since we can't use the rc tools natively yet\nwe can cheat. This assumes your kernel is configured to use the legacy network\nnames (which are more consistent and predictable :-/). This will setup eth0 to\ncome up automatically and use DHCP to grab an address on the network:\ncat &lt;&lt; 'EOF' &gt; /usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi/etc/conf.d/net\n# /etc/conf.d/net\nmodules=\"iproute2\"\n\n# Default DHCP config for interfaces\ndhcp=\"release nonis nontp\"\n\nconfig_eth0=\"dhcp\"\nEOF\n\necho 'arm-board' &gt; /usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi/etc/hostname\necho 'hostname=\"arm-board.localhost\"' &gt; /usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi/etc/conf.d/hostname\ncat &lt;&lt; 'EOF' &gt; /usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi/etc/hosts\n# /etc/hosts\n\n127.0.0.1 localhost4 localhost\n::1       localhost6 localhost\nEOF\n\ncd /usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi/etc/init.d/\nln -s net.lo net.eth0\n\ncd /usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi/etc/runlevels/default/\nln -s /etc/init.d/net.eth0 net.eth0\nrm -f netmount\n\nKernel Modules\nPart of the kernel build that has to happen still in the PetaLinux environment\nare kernel modules. One of the build artifacts is the root filesystem PetaLinux\nthinks you're going to use. These contain very important kernel modules which\nneed to be extracted.\nInside the root of your PetaLinux project after a build you should find a file\nimages/linux/rootfs.tar.gz which will have a directory inside it\n./lib/modules. The contents need to be transferred to your root filesystem.\nIf you transfer that to the system you're building the board root on you can\nextract all of the appropriate files using the following command:\ntar -xf rootfs.tar.gz -C /usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi/ ./lib/modules\n\nYou can verify they are present by confirming a directory that looks along the\nlines of 4.9.0-xilinx-v2017.2 exists in\n/usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi/lib/modules/.\nSSH Server\nIf you would additionally like an SSH server running (that supports root\nlogin) there is a bit of a trick. User privilege separation requires a\ndedicated user and group named sshd for this to work.\nThe OpenSSH ebuild doesn't create this user and I'm not entirely sure what\ndoes. For now we can solve this issue by creating the user and group manually.\narm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi-emerge net-misc/openssh\n\necho 'sshd:x:22:22:added by portage for openssh:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin' &gt;&gt; /usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi/etc/passwd\necho 'sshd:*:0:0:::::' &gt;&gt; /usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi/etc/shadow\necho 'sshd:x:22:' &gt;&gt; /usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi/etc/group\n\ncat &lt;&lt; 'EOF' &gt; /usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi/etc/ssh/sshd_config\n# /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\nHostKeyAlgorithms ssh-ed25519,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,ssh-rsa\n\nClientAliveInterval 10\n\nUseDNS no\n\nAllowTcpForwarding no\nUsePAM yes\n\nPasswordAuthentication yes\nPermitRootLogin yes\nEOF\n\ncd /usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi/etc/runlevels/default/\nln -s /etc/init.d/sshd sshd\n\nAdditional Tools\nThis is a pretty solid foundation for any root Linux system. Everything at this\npoint is going to preferential and determined by your project requirements. A\nfew things you may want to include:\n\nVIM\nNTPd or Chronyd for time keeping\nA syslog server (I recommend syslog-ng) and in turn logrotate\nNetwork performance testing tools (such as iperf3)\n\nFrom the above list I wanted both VIM and iperf3 and thus ran the following:\necho 'net-misc/iperf ~arm' &gt; /usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/network_utils\necho 'app-editors/vim minimal' &gt; /usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi/etc/portage/package.use/vim\narm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi-emerge app-editors/vim net-misc/iperf\n\nRebuilding on the System\nOnce all the packages you want for your base system are installed, the root may\nbe in an inconsitent state. It's a good idea to run a sync, global use update,\na preserved rebuild, and dependency clean on the board before continuing:\nemerge --sync\narm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi-emerge --update --newuse --deep @world\narm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi-emerge @preserved-rebuild\narm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi-emerge --depclean\n\nWe now need to get the root filesystem on a live board and rebuilding cleaning\nup some of the mismatch package flags and irregularities introduced by the\ncross compilation process. At a minimum want to fix the incorrectly built\nportage package so everything is usable normally.\nBefore transferring this it's a good idea to preemptively adjust the make\nconfig to no longer be a cross environment, and remove the special case for\nportage. This can be done with the following command:\ncat &lt;&lt; 'EOF' &gt; /usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi/etc/portage/make.conf\nARCH='arm'\nCFLAGS='-O2 -pipe'\nCXXFLAGS=\"${CFLAGS}\"\nCHOST='arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi'\n\nACCEPT_KEYWORDS='arm'\nFEATURES='sandbox noman noinfo nodoc'\nUSE=\"${ARCH} pam\"\n\nELIBC='glibc'\n\nL10N='en'\nLINGUAS='en'\n\nPYTHON_TARGETS='python2_7'\nEOF\n\nrm -f /usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi/etc/portage/package.use/portage\n\nWe now need to package up our root filesystem:\ntar -cJf ~/xilinx_root_non_native.txz -C /usr/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi .\n\nThis next bit requires the proper settings in PetaLinux and a completed build\n(you'll need your own BOOT.BIN, image.ub, and system.dtb files). After\ninserting an appropriately size SD card (You're going to want 4 or 8Gb more\nlikely than not). For me the device showed up as mmcblk0 on my machine. Confirm\nyours before following the next steps:\ndd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=1 oflag=sync of=/dev/mmcblk0\n\nparted --script -a optimal /dev/mmcblk0 -- mklabel msdos\nparted --script -a optimal /dev/mmcblk0 -- mkpart primary fat32 100 600\nparted --script -a optimal /dev/mmcblk0 -- mkpart primary ext4 600 -1\n\ndd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=1 oflag=sync of=/dev/mmcblk0p1\ndd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=1 oflag=sync of=/dev/mmcblk0p2\n\nmkfs.vfat -n BOOT -F 32 /dev/mmcblk0p1\nmkfs.ext4 -L rootfs /dev/mmcblk0p2\n\nmkdir -p /mnt/boot\nmount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt/boot\n\nmkdir -p /mnt/root\nmount /dev/mmcblk0p2 /mnt/root\n\nYou'll need to copy BOOT.BIN, image.ub, and system.dtb to /mnt/boot and\nextract the root filesystem into the root directory (compressed version still\nlives at ~/xilinx_root_non_native.txz).\ntar -xf ~/xilinx_root_non_native.txz -C /mnt/root\n\nEnsure the writes complete and cleanly unmount the filesystems:\nsync\numount /mnt/boot /mnt/root\n\nStick the microSD card into the board and let it boot up. If you're following\nthis guide you should be able to get to a login screen and be able to login\nwith root / root.\nThe device should be on the network and you should be able to SSH to the\ndevice. For my board at the very least I haven't gotten the hardware clock\nworking correctly so it needs to be set manually upon every boot. Before we can\ncompile quite a few of the packages the date needs to be roughly correct. You\ncan reference the build host's time using the following command:\ndate +%s\n\nAnd set it on the board using the following command (replacing VALUE with\nthe value returned above):\ndate --set=\"@VALUE\"\n\nWe now need to sync the system's packages and fix portage. This is where we\nhave to work around the issue of portage being incorrectly installed by\nprefixing any use of the portage python module with a '64 bit' path:\nPYTHONPATH='/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages' env-update\n\ncat &lt;&lt; 'EOF' &gt; /etc/locale.gen\nen_US ISO-8859-1\nen_US.UTF-8 UTF-8\nEOF\nlocale-gen\n\nPYTHONPATH='/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages' eselect locale set \"$(eselect locale list | grep 'en_US.utf8' | awk '{ print $1 }' | grep -oE '[0-9]+')\"\nPYTHONPATH='/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages' env-update\n\n. /etc/profile\n\nPYTHONPATH='/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages' emerge --sync\nPYTHONPATH='/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages' emerge --oneshot sys-apps/portage\n\n# There is a circular dependency that has to be broken during this update\nUSE=\"dev-util/pkgconfig internal-glib\" emerge dev-util/pkgconfig\n\n# With the circular update broken we can update everything (this will recompile\n# pkgconfig again)\nemerge --update --newuse --deep @world\n\nThe last will recompile quite a few packages (though not all). I recommend\nshutting the system down, removing the SD card and making a clean backup of the\nroot by performing the following commands once the drive is back in your\nmachine (this assumes the same device name as before):\nmount /dev/mmcblk0p2 /mnt/root\nrm -rf /mnt/root/root/.bash_history /mnt/root/etc/ssh/ssh_host* /usr/portage/*\ntar -cJf ~/xilinx_root_native.txz -C /mnt/root .\n\nYou now have a solid base to perform development on and a good backup in case\nyou mess up. I hope this helps someone else out there.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2017/cross-compiling-gentoo-for-xilinx-boards/","title":"Cross-Compiling Gentoo for Xilinx Boards"},"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2017/downgrading-glibc-in-gentoo/":{"body":"While refining some automated setup scripts at some point I upgraded to a\ntesting/unstable version of glibc.

There also didn't seem to be much reliable information on the\nproblem so I'm documenting it here in hopes it may help someone else.\nIn addition to the read-only filesystem, none of the system services would\nstart up leaving me with the kernel's default hostname of (none). This\nincludes networking so I had to diagnose this directly via the console. I was\nable to login as a user but unable to use sudo to switch to a new user\n(though I could still use it to execute commands with elevated privileges).\nI was able to verify all the OpenRC services had not started with by executing:\nsudo rc-status\n\nI attempted to start the SSH daemon (though any networked service should behave\nthe same) using the following command:\nsudo service sshd start\n\nThis was the first time any error had directly presented itself to my screen\n(and since my filesystems were read-only, and my logger was stopped I had no on\ndisk logs to go off from). The error that was repeated over my screen was the\nfollowing:\n * Checking local filesystems  .../sbin/fsck.xfs: XFS file system.\nfsck.fat 4.0 (2016-05-06)\nopen: No such file or directory\n\n * Filesystems couldn't be fixed\n                                         [ !! ]\n * ERROR: fsck failed to start\n * ERROR: cannot start root as fsck would not start\n\nThis was quite confusing and more than a little concerning as XFS doesn't use\nfsck, instead it uses xfs_repair. There was also the \"No such file or\ndirectory\" error which also didn't seem to make sense.\nUltimately, after reviewing the fsck init script I found the culprit. There\nwas a bad line in my /etc/fstab file pointing at a device that didn't exist.\nI was able to remount my root filesystem read-write and edit my fstab to fix\nthe device name in my fstab file:\nsudo mount -o remount,rw /\nsudoedit /etc/fstab\n\nTracing things back, this was ultimately caused by the Gentoo installation\nmedium detecting it's only disk as /dev/sda while the kernel I use exposed it\nas /dev/vda.

The simpler form is the\nfollowing format:\n-w /etc/shadow -p wa\n-w /boot -p wa\n-w /etc/dont_readme -p r\n\nThese three rules are all behaving slightly differently. The first will audit\nany writes or attribute changes to the shadow file. The second, being a\ndirectory, will be recursively watched for writes and attribute changes\n(including the directory itself). The last line will create an audit record\nwhenever the file is read.\nThe second form is more consistent with the syscall rule types but more\nverbose. Examples are given in the man page for converting between the two\nforms. Before I show you an example of those rules, this is the part of the man\npage that ultimately confused me:\n\nIf you place a watch on a file, its the same as using the -F path option on a\nsyscall rule.\n\nSimple enough, this is what the first line of the first example would look like\nin this style:\n-a always,exit -F path=/etc/shadow -F perm=wa\n\nBefore changing my rules over to this form I checked a couple to ensure they\nwere behaving correctly then migrated the rest. After applying the new rules I\nfound quite a few audit records I'd expect missing. If I had kept reading (the\nnext line from the last man page) I would have found this:\n\nIf you place a watch on a directory, its the same as using the -F dir option\non a syscall rule.\n\nSo the correct way to represent the second line in the first example would be\nlike this:\n-a always,exit -F dir=/boot -F perm=wa\n\nThe long and short of it, is that the watch flag (-w) has different behaviors\ndepending on what it is pointing at. Having only read the first sentence, I\nassumed the path= argument would behave the same as a watch. Attempts to\nGoogle whether or not path= was recursive didn't turn up anything.

You can find it in the NIST Guide to General Server\nSecurity (published in 2008).\nI've replicated section 2.4 from the linked document (I have removed the\nfootnotes, but it is otherwise unchanged) in its entirety here for safe keeping\nand to hopefully help expose this to more people.\nWhen addressing server security issues, it is an excellent idea to keep in mind\nthe following general information security principles:\nSimplicity --- Security mechanisms (and information systems in general)\nshould be as simple as possible. Complexity is at the root of many security\nissues. \nFail-Safe --- If a failure occurs, the system should fail in a secure\nmanner, i.e., security controls and settings remain in effect and are enforced.\nIt is usually better to lose functionality rather than security.\nComplete Mediation --- Rather than providing direct access to information,\nmediators that enforce access policy should be employed. Common examples of\nmediators include file system permissions, proxies, firewalls, and mail\ngateways.\nOpen Design --- System security should not depend on the secrecy of the\nimplementation or its components.\nSeparation of Privilege --- Functions, to the degree possible, should be\nseparate and provide as much granularity as possible. The concept can apply to\nboth systems and operators and users. In the case of systems, functions such as\nread, edit, write, and execute should be separate. In the case of system\noperators and users, roles should be as separate as possible. For example, if\nresources allow, the role of system administrator should be separate from that\nof the database administrator.\nLeast Privilege --- This principle dictates that each task, process, or\nuser is granted the minimum rights required to perform its job. By applying\nthis principle consistently, if a task, process, or user is compromised, the\nscope of damage is constrained to the limited resources available to the\ncompromised entity.\nPsychological Acceptability --- Users should understand the necessity of\nsecurity. This can be provided through training and education. In addition, the\nsecurity mechanisms in place should present users with sensible options that\ngive them the usability they require on a daily basis. If users find the\nsecurity mechanisms too cumbersome, they may devise ways to work around or\ncompromise them. The objective is not to weaken security so it is\nunderstandable and acceptable, but to train and educate users and to design\nsecurity mechanisms and policies that are usable and effective.\nLeast Common Mechanism --- When providing a feature for the system, it is\nbest to have a single process or service gain some function without granting\nthat same function to other parts of the system. The ability for the Web server\nprocess to access a back-end database, for instance, should not also enable\nother applications on the system to access the back-end database.\nDefense-in-Depth --- Organizations should understand that a single security\nmechanism is generally insufficient. Security mechanisms (defenses) need to be\nlayered so that compromise of a single security mechanism is insufficient to\ncompromise a host or network. No \"silver bullet\" exists for information system\nsecurity.\nWork Factor --- Organizations should understand what it would take to\nbreak the system or network’s security features. The amount of work necessary\nfor an attacker to break the system or network should exceed the value that the\nattacker would gain from a successful compromise.\nCompromise Recording --- Records and logs should be maintained so that if a\ncompromise does occur, evidence of the attack is available to the organization.\nThis information can assist in securing the network and host after the\ncompromise and aid in identifying the methods and exploits used by the\nattacker. This information can be used to better secure the host or network in\nthe future. In addition, these records and logs can assist organizations in\nidentifying and prosecuting attackers.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2017/security-principles/","title":"Security Principles"},"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2017/the-case-of-an-empty-executable/":{"body":"I recently came across a short article written about a decade ago. It was\na curious thing already as it was hosted in a user's home directory off a web\nserver with the standard ~&lt;username&gt; showing up in the URL. The important\npart that caught my eye was this:\n\nThe \"true\" program does nothing; it merely exits with a zero exit status.\nThis can be done with an empty file that's marked executable, and that's what\nit was in the earliest unix system libraries.\n\nBeing a curious sort, and presented with an old mystery, I had to try out this\nlittle tidbit of information:\n$ echo -n &gt; test\n$ chmod +x test\n$ ./test\n$ echo $?\n0\n\nSure enough, an empty file can be successfully run. It obviously doesn't have a\nknown binary header, so it won't be interpretted as a valid executable on it's\nown. Even scripts rely on the shebang header (#!) to be considered valid by\nthe kernel, so something else has to be executing this. We can confirm the\nkernel isn't recognizing this by abusing strace into calling an explicit\nexecve on the file:\n$ strace ./test\nexecve(\"./test\", [\"./test\"], 0x7ffe74e0a720 /* 70 vars */) = -1 ENOEXEC (Exec format error)\nfstat(2, {st_mode=S_IFCHR|0620, st_rdev=makedev(136, 3), ...}) = 0\nwrite(2, \"strace: exec: Exec format error\\n\", 32strace: exec: Exec format error\n) = 32\ngetpid()                                = 24047\nexit_group(1)                           = ?\n+++ exited with 1 +++\n\nThis is exactly what I was expecting and the Kernel source reflects\nexactly what I'd expect. I'll leave it up to you test the results on an empty\nbut otherwise valid shell script. With the kernel cleared of any odd behavior I\nwas left with only one suspect. A little shell by the name of bash.\nBash is a coy devil with several different mechanisms built-in to execute a\nprogram. Likely one of these culprits are being used behind the scenes when we\nrun a program. A quick trip the man page and a late night cup of coffee\nnarrowed down my search to the following functions:\n\ncommand\neval\nexec\n\nI decided it was time to talk to each of them one by one and see what was up.\nPutting them under the bright light I was surprised that they all were telling\nthe same story:\n$ command ./test\n$ echo $?\n0\n$ eval ./test\n$ echo $?\n0\n$ exec ./test\n-bash: /home/playground/test: Success\n\nHow sinister! Someone had gotten to them first, I have to go higher into their\norganization. This calls for... The Source. I quickly traverse into the builtin\ndirectory and identify the commonality parse_and_execute. This is where it\ngets a little fuzzy as bash is a rather complicated code base and I didn't want\nto spend to much time on this in the middle of the night.\nAfter parsing the file, it does seem to treat it as a script (as expected).\nThere are two possibilities here and I didn't trace down which was true. Either\nparse_and_execute is simply returning with a success or it is sending the\ncontents to execute_command_internal, which in turn defaults to a\nsuccessfully return value.\nThe motive remains unclear, but no harm seems to be getting done so I'm going\nto call this one case closed.

From the messages I read, if you want this a cheap Gigabit\nswitch between your router and the fiber jack that you can additionally plug\nthe TV box into will do the trick (but you want to avoid powering the jack with\nPoE if you go this route).\nThere was some discussion from an official Google representative in one of the\nmany threads that made a passing mention they would switch to untagged traffic\nso I wanted to verify what was happening. For this I became the wire and\nsniffed the traffic directly. The settings on the wire matched the contents of\na deleted post from a Google representative early on in this thread\nreproduced here for future reference:\n\nHere's the gory details if you really want to use your own router:\n\nTraffic in/out of the fiberjack is vlan tagged with vlan2.\nDHCP traffic should have 802.1p bit = 2\nIGMP traffic should have 802.1p bit = 6\nAll other internet traffic 802.1p bit = 3\n\nYou can send data without the 802.1p bits but your performance will get\nthrottled to something like 10Mbit.\nNOTE:  This data is subject to change.  We are planning on changing the data\nin/out of the fiberjack to be untagged, which will then make it really easy\nfor you to connect your own router.\nA word of warning, most consumer routers don't have hardware forwarding (that\nis my feeble understanding) so you might not be happy with the performance on\nyour network, and which will also probably affect tv service quality.\n\nOne other piece of information that I gleaned from the traffic capture is that\nthe IPv6 prefix length of /56. If you want to reproduce this, look into the\nDHCPv6 messages for a pair of solicit / request (actually a response but that\nis how it is labeled).\nI had some initial concern about VLAN tagging as I suspected it may force\nsoftware handling of all routed packets. The EdgeRouter PoE has hardware\noffloading for VLAN tagging available so this is not an issue for this router.\nFor anyone using this as a reference for another router, you'll want to make\nsure yours supports this.\nBasic Connectivity\nThe first task was to get basic IPv4 connectivity going. When I started the\nconfiguration my router was on version 1.9.1.1, which I upgraded to 1.10.1\nafter I finished all of the configuration. I didn't have any issues with the\nsoftware, everything seemed very stable.\nThe basic connectivity just requires tagging outbound traffic with VLAN 2, to\nget the full speed the packets additionally need to have the correct 802.1q QoS\ntags. The one bonus we'll add that is totally unecessary is powering the jack\nwith PoE since we're already going to messing with that interface.\nSidenote: If you want to play with egress values, changing after the fact\nrequires editing of the config on disk and a full restart. It's kind of a\npain to go through a bunch of different options.\nThe EdgeRouter PoE doesn't seem to be able to adjust QoS settings based on the\nprotocol (I could be wrong I didn't look into this too deeply, maybe the\nadvanced traffic control stuff?), but since I don't have the TV service, I\ndon't have the IGMP traffic to worry about. That just leaves DHCPv4 packets.\nI confirmed that DHCPv4 will get an address when tagged with a QoS value of 3\n(which is what the bulk traffic should be tagged with). Later on, I go into\ndetail about an issue that I think could be potentially related to this\nbut I haven't done additional testing.\nI tried several mapping values for different types of traffic and settled on\nmapping everything to a QoS value of 3 (option 3 below). The mappings that I\ntried are:\n\n0:2\n0:3\n0:3 1:3 2:3 3:3 4:3 5:3 6:3 7:3\n0:3 1:3 2:3 3:3 4:4 5:5 6:6 7:7\n0:6\n\nTo configure the router, connect the fiber jack to eth0 on the router and make\nsure the fiber jack doesn't have its external power connected. SSH into your\nrouter (this will depend on your current settings, or do a full reset and use\nthe default static IP setting) and go into configure mode:\nconfigure\n\nThere are a lot of changes that need to be made, the one thing you'll want to\ndouble check is the name of your firewall rules which should have already been\nsetup. By default they get named WAN_IN, WANv6_IN, WAN_LOCAL, and\nWANv6_LOCAL and I didn't need to make any changes to them to get things\nworking. Because there are so many changes from the default WAN settings, we're\ngoing to start from a clean slate:\ndelete interfaces ethernet eth0\n\nNow we need to setup the physical connection details again and we'll add the\nPoE configuration to power the jack. Please note that these will not go into\neffect until we commit them (which we're going to wait to do until later).\nedit interfaces ethernet eth0\nset description \"Google Fiber Jack\"\nset duplex auto\nset speed auto\nset poe output 48v\nexit\n\nWe're now going to want to create the VLAN interface on eth0, which is done\nthrough the vif sub-commands off the interface. While not necessary yet,\nwe'll also place the IPv6 firewalls in place, even if you don't intend to using\nIPv6 having these in place can prevent accidents if it ever gets enabled.\nedit interfaces ethernet eth0 vif 2\nset description Internet\nset address dhcp\nset egress-qos \"0:3 1:3 2:3 3:3 4:3 5:3 6:3 7:3\"\nset firewall in name WAN_IN\nset firewall in ipv6-name WANv6_IN\nset firewall local name WAN_LOCAL\nset firewall local name WANv6_IN\nexit\n\nTo ensure the routing performance is as good as it can be, we want to ensure\nthe relevant hardware offload settings are configured:\nedit system offload\nset ipv4 forwarding enable\nset ipv4 vlan enable\nexit\n\nAt this point we need to commit the change to allow the VLAN interface to be\ncreated. Routing won't work yet, but this will power the jack and get it\nbooting. To get basic routing working the outbound interface for NAT will also\nneed to be updated and recommitted. You'll want to double check your NAT rule\nnumber matches mine (5010).\ncommit\nset service nat rule 5010 outbound-interface eth0.2\ncommit\n\nNow you'll have to wait a while for everything to come up, which can be up to\nfive minutes but your IPv4 connectivity should be all set.\nI also setup IPv6 separately using DHCPv6-PD, giving a separate /64 network to\neach of my internal networks. I'm going to leave that for another post though.\nChanging the egress-qos Value\nIf you want to change the egress-qos value after the VLAN interface comes up\nyou'll be presented with the following error message:\nadmin@ubnt-router:~$ configure\n[edit]\nadmin@ubnt-router# set interfaces ethernet eth0 vif 2 egress-qos \"0:2\"\n[edit]\nadmin@ubnt-router# commit\negress-qos can only be set at vlan creation for 2\n\nCommit failed\n[edit]\n\nTo actually change this value, you need to switch to root, and use vi to edit\nthe /config/config.boot file and reboot the router itself.\nInitial Connectivity Time\nSeveral time during the course of testing this I assumed I had broken my\nconnectivity while testing. I was actually experiencing surprisingly long\ndelays getting connectivity after changes. Part of this is that the PoE to the\nfiber jack isn't maintained while the router is rebooting, forcing the jack to\nboot as well, but a large portion of that is the IPv4 connectivity itself.\nThe timings I measured during a reboot were:\n\n1 minute 18 seconds to first ping of internal LAN interface\nAn additional 35 seconds before the SSH port was open\n19 more seconds before logins were allowed\nA further 33 seconds before the router saw the link from the fiber jack come\nup\n22 seconds until IPv6 connectivity was established (internal hosts now have\nIPv6 internet)\nAn additional 3 minutes 46 seconds before the eth0.2 interface gets an IPv4\naddress and IPv4 connectivity is available.\n\nTotal boot time: 5 minutes 53 seconds. That is pretty crazy and it's almost all\nwaiting for an IPv4 address on the link. Either something is really slow on\nGoogle's end, or this delay is because the DHCP traffic is tagged with an\nincorrect QoS value (I haven't tested it).\nEither way, reboots once setup are pretty rare and I can wait the almost six\nminutes without internet when it happens.\nMSS Clamping\nSteve Jenkins's post has the most complete documentation on setting up the\nEdgeRouter (and makes his configs available on GitHub), but I was a tad\nconfused about him using MSS clamping, which I've left out of my config.\nMSS clamping is used to restrict MTU sizes through TCP headers, and is very\nuseful when tunneling traffic or wrapping in an authentication mechanism such\nas PPPoE, MPLS, or GRE. During the crafting of packets, hosts won't be aware of\nthe tunnel which will have its own MTU and packet overhead and thus can hit\nsome performance snags.\nWith this config, we are at most adding 4 bytes to each packet as a VLAN tag\nbut won't encounter a tunnel that will break a packet up into multiple tunneled\npackets when a packet is to large and rebuild it at the other exactly the same.\nAny fragmentation that occurs in transit will be visible to the MSS detection\nalgorithms and handled correctly without the overhead or limitation of MSS\nclamping. If anything I'd expect it to slow down the connection slightly for\nlarge packets.\nNotes for the post:\nRaw config:\n/* Everything in this section with the one exception are defaults */\nfirewall {\n

Most people now use it with one or another central repository\neven when working on large teams which is perfectly fine if that model works\nfor you and your team.\nIt can be useful to quickly work with others on private repositories without\nrequiring them to get on your platform of choice, or for sensitive repositories\nkeep the repository entirely under your control. Occasionally platforms like\nGitHub have service outages, and while you won't have access to any of your\nintegrations a private repository can quickly allow your team to keep\ncollaborating.\nIf you're using Linux or Mac OS X, setting up a local repo that you can push to\nis trivial. You simply create a place for it, initialize it as a git repo, then\npush to it like so:\nmkdir -p ~/repos/private_repo.git\ncd ~/repos/private_repo.git\ngit init --bare\n\nIn the directory that contains your current repository add the new repo\ndestination as an origin and push the contents to it:\ngit remote add local ~/repos/private_repo.git\ngit push local --all\n\nHaving another copy of your repository locally doesn't do you much good.

I really enjoyed giving the talk,\nhowever, I left a few questions unanswered. While I may do a more extensive\npost on everything that I went through in the talk (I have been lax on writing\ncontent for this blog), this post is more to answer the outstanding questions\nand of course to make my slides available.\nAs far as I remember the only question I wasn't able to answer was about file\ndescriptors related to TCP connections. It isn't exactly a firewall issue but\nexhaustion of file descriptors is one of the issues I've seen blamed on the\nfirewall (which in turn was relevant to the talk).\nEstablished TCP connections consume file descriptors on Linux systems. Each\nuser session is restricted by a limit defined by the system administrator (or\nmore likely using the distribution's defaults). Some services consume a large\nnumber of file descriptors for their basic operations before any network\nconnections are involved (Redis and Elasticsearch being two common\nservices that both recommend increasing this limit).\nWhen file descriptors are exhausted there are two common behaviors of\napplications depending on how they're written. The first and more common\nbehavior will an immediately terminated connection, which to the user will look\nquite similar to a iptables REJECT response. The less common behavior is\nwaiting until a file descriptor to become available before accepting the\nconnection, which will result in a hanging incomplete connection much like an\niptables DROP target.\nAn important caveat here is that I'm talking about user perception. If you look\nat the packets being exchanged, it's clear that this isn't the case.\nA quick way to diagnose if this is an issue is to compare the current number of\nopen file descriptors by a user to their limit. In my experience most of these\ncommands are available to unprivileged users which is also handy if there is a\ncomplicated process for using or executing commands with elevated privileges.\nFirst let's check what the total number of open file descriptors are on the\nsystem:\n[user@sample-host] ~ $ lsof | wc -l\n185779\n\nIf it is under 10,000 there is a very good chance this is not the problem\nyou're looking for. If you see a large number like the output above, it is\nworth investigating more. The host that I sampled that from currently has no\nfile descriptor issues.\nFirst you'll want to identify the main process of the application that is\nhaving issues. Make sure you note the user that the application is running as.\nIdentify the current configured limits for that process (replace &lt;PID&gt; with\nthe pid you just found):\n[user@sample-host] ~ $ grep 'open files' /proc/&lt;PID&gt;/limits\nMax open files            1024                 4096                 files\n\nThis tells the process is currently operating with a soft limit of 1,024 file\ndescriptors and a hard limit of 4,096. This is where the diagnostics can get a\nlittle fuzzy. File descriptors are limited by user session not by process or\nuser which is what we can directly query on. To get a rough idea of where we're\nat lets query those two specifics.\n[user@sample-host] ~ $ lsof -p &lt;PID&gt; | wc -l\n5\n[user@sample-host] ~ $ lsof -u &lt;USER&gt; | wc -l\n721\n\nThis particular example is enough for us to clearly see file descriptors are\nnot an issue. The current number of file descriptors open for the user (721) is\nbelow the process's soft limit of 1,024. If the number of file descriptors is\ncloser to our limits you'll have to get an exact count of what is going on.\nUnfortunately I don't know an easy one liner to check this.\nTo get an exact count you need to enumerate all processes with the same session\nidentifier (SID) as your target process, query them all for the current file\ndescriptor consumption, and add them up into a total. As a rule of thumb I\nrecommend leaving about a 25% overhead for your service during peak load which\ncan be set in your system limits file for that service's user.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2018/its-never-the-firewall/","title":"It's Never the Firewall"},"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2018/parsing-http-responses-in-ruby/":{"body":"Normally handling HTTP responses in Ruby is rather straight forward. There is a\nnative library in Ruby that handles HTTP requests which parses the responses\ninto a neat data structure that you can then operate on. What if you want to\nwork on stored HTTP responses outside of a connection though? This was the\nsituation I found myself in and thanks to a series of unusual decisions in the\nRuby core library I found myself left out in the cold.\nFor reference this is in the latest stable Ruby as of this writing (2.5.1).\nLet's start with a very small HTTP response stored in a variable for us to test\non:\nraw_http_body = &lt;&lt;-BODY.rstrip\nJust the body...\nBODY\n\nraw_http_response = &lt;&lt;-RESP.rstrip\nHTTP/1.1 200 Ok\\r\nConnection: close\\r\nContent-Length: #{raw_http_body.bytesize}\\r\n\\r\n#{raw_http_body}\nRESP\n\nThe above is a little bit weird but is a minimum reasonable HTTP response. All\nlines are approprietly terminated with both a carriage return (explicit) and\na newline (implicit in how the strings are defined). The Content-Length\nheader is the exact number of bytes present in the body (thus the two #rstrip\ncalls). The Date header was omitted due to this line in RFC7231\n\nAn origin server MUST NOT send a Date header field if it does not have a\nclock capable of providing a reasonable approximation of the current instance\nin Coordinated Universal Time.\n\n...Which the content of this static site does not have.\nWith our minimal response out of the way how do we go about parsing it? The\nRuby 2.5.1 stdlib documentation doesn't specify how it can be created by\nend users which usually means it isn't intended for use by users of the\nlanguage directly and digging through the Ruby source, you'll see this is\nprecisely the case. Which means Ruby does not have a HTTP response parser\navailable in it's standard library. This is pretty frustrating, but maybe it\ncan be worked around.\nHow does the Net::HTTP library make use of it? Even if the methods aren't\nlisted for public documentation they're still public APIs on the class and\nshould be able to be used without monkey patching right? The response is setup\nin the connect method of Net::HTTP and it comes down to a few relevant\nlines that can be summarized as:\n\nOpen a socket to the webserver\nWrite the formatted request to the socket\nPass the socket to HTTPResponse#read_new\n\nSo we need a socket like object containing our response, which we can do with\nStringIO and pass it to the appropriate method. Let's see what happens:\nrequire 'net/http'\nrequire 'stringio'\n\nresp_io = StringIO.new(raw_http_response)\nresponse = Net::HTTPResponse.read_new(resp_io)\n\nWe get a raised exception:\n\nNet::HTTPBadResponse: wrong status line: \"HTTP/1.1 200 Ok\\r\\n\"\n\nThat is definitely a valid status line, so what is going on here? Back to\nRuby's source code... Net::HTTPResponse#read_new starts off by calling\nNet::HTTPResponse#read_status_line which uses this regex for extracting and\nchecking the validity of the status line:\n/\\AHTTP(?:\\/(\\d+\\.\\d+))?\\s+(\\d\\d\\d)(?:\\s+(.*))?\\z/in\n\nI had never seen the /n modifier for Ruby's regular expressions and it seems\nto be completely undocumented. This turned out to be a red herring as it simply\nsets Regexp::NOENCODING (had to dig into the\nspec/ruby/core/regexp/options_spec.rb file to figure that one out).\nSo why isn't that regular expression matching? Spoiler: It's the newline (the\ncarriage return is fine). That is a violation of the HTTP spec, but it is\nworking normally for Ruby's HTTP requests so what gives? Apparently we have to\ngo deeper...\nIt's getting the header string by calling #readline which on standard IO\nobjects returns the newline (The IO class if the base for StringIO, and\nSocket objects in addition to many others). In Ruby 2.4 and later there\nis a chomp flag that changes this behavior but it isn't being used in this\ncase, and it would take the carriage return with it if it was.\nSo... We must not be operating on an actual IO subclass... And sure enough,\nNet::HTTP#connect after getting the raw socket wraps it in a\nNet::BufferedIO object which is another internal hidden class. You can see\nthe definition of it here and here is its #readline method:\ndef readline\n  readuntil(\"\\n\").chop\nend\n\nYep, for some reason this one private internal API has decided to complicate a\nRuby standard API convention and strip off the trailing carriage return and new\nline. Wrapping our StringIO object in a BufferedIO object does solve this\nproblem but there is no reason for these complications...\nresp_io = StringIO.new(raw_http_response)\nbuf_io = Net::BufferedIO.new(resp_io)\nresponse = Net::HTTPResponse.read_new(buf_io)\n\nOr does it?\nresponse.body\n# NoMethodError: undefined method `closed?' for nil:NilClass\n\nWe need to pull one more trick from the Net::HTTP#transport_request to get\nthe body. The first line actually returns the body, but we want to treat this\nlike a normal HTTPResponse so we want to make sure the #body method works:\nresponse.reading_body(buf_io, true) { yield res if block_given? }\nresponse.body\n\nThere are a couple of differences still from a normal response body. The only\none of particular note to me is that normally the response get it's #uri data\nfrom the request. This isn't available with the response alone but can be set\npretty easily:\nrequire 'uri'\nresponse.uri = URI.parse('http://example.tld')\n\nAltogether this is what it looks like:\nrequire 'net/http'\nrequire 'stringio'\nrequire 'uri'\n\nraw_http_body = &lt;&lt;-BODY.rstrip\nJust the body...\nBODY\n\nraw_http_response = &lt;&lt;-RESP.rstrip\nHTTP/1.1 200 Ok\\r\nConnection: close\\r\nContent-Length: #{raw_http_body.bytesize}\\r\n\\r\n#{raw_http_body}\nRESP\n\nresp_io = StringIO.new(raw_http_response)\nbuf_io = Net::BufferedIO.new(resp_io)\n\nresponse = Net::HTTPResponse.read_new(buf_io)\nresponse.reading_body(buf_io, true) { yield res if block_given? }\nresponse.uri = URI.parse('http://example.tld')\n\n# You now have a valid Net::HTTPResponse object\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2018/parsing-http-responses-in-ruby/","title":"Parsing HTTP Responses in Ruby"},"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2018/performance-impact-of-openvpn-portsharing/":{"body":"I recently had cause to use OpenVPN on the standard HTTPS port to protect my\ntraffic.

In an age when airports, and coffee\nshops are outsourcing 'free wifi' to corporate entities that are likely\nharvesting as much data as they can this is a nice addition. I largely use VPNs\nwhen connected to these access points which provides at least as good\nprotection as DNS-over-TLS which has caused me to largely overlook this\ndevelopment.\nWhen I found out that Android 9 natively supports this through the 'Private\nDNS' feature I got significantly more interested. I've always wanted to dictate\nwhat DNS server my phone used, not for privacy reasons but rather to provide\nanother layer of security when not connected to my VPN. When you're in control\nof your DNS server you can blacklist known malicious domains and as an added\nbonus the worst of the ad and tracking networks.\nTurns out DNS-over-TLS is incredibly simple. It makes no changes to normal DNS\npackets, it just wraps the TCP queries in a TLS tunnel with a preconfigured\nserver address for certificate validation.\nI use unbound for my DNS server of choice which natively supports exposing a\nTLS protected port, but with a very limited config. My preferred choice of\ndealing with this is instead to use Nginx to proxy locally to unbound, allowing\nme to ensure the TLS config matches current best practices and limits access to\nthe servers TLS private key to a single service.\nThe downside of using Nginx is that you lose the ability to log which internet\naddresses are making requests (as the stream access_log directive doesn't seem\nto be working for the packaged Nginx server). Since this is an unauthenticated\nservice I'm slightly concerned about anonymous use and abuse but will address\nthat if it ever becomes an issue.\nFirst off we need to ensure we have a working local resolver on our host.

The next step is to add our TLS layer with Nginx.\nNginx\nWith a resolver setup the next bit is to setup Nginx to proxy requests to the\nresolver. You need to have a trusted TLS certificate and key for your server's\ndomain name. Let's Encrypt works great for this and I use both an ECDSA\ncert/key pair and an RSA cert/key pair but you can use one or the other if that\nis your preference. I'll cover requesting these certificates in a future post,\nin the mean time there are plenty of existing Let's Encrypt tutorials.\nThis can be a bit tricky as anyone reading this might have an Nginx config in\nplace already. It'll be up to you to merge this config with yours. To assist\nwith this merging I've kept the Nginx config as minimal while still being\ncompletely functional as possible and avoided using includes to increase the\nclarity of the config.\nOn Fedora 28 you'll need both the nginx and the nginx-mod-stream package.\nAfter installing them both you'll want to place the following config to\n/etc/nginx/nginx.conf.\n# /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n\nerror_log /var/log/nginx/error.log warn;\nuser nginx;\nworker_processes auto;\n\nevents {\n  worker_connections 1024;\n}\n\n# Needs to be loaded before the http or stream blocks are used\nload_module \"/usr/lib64/nginx/modules/ngx_stream_module.so\";\n\n# This is where your normal http block would live\n#http {\n#}\n\nstream {\n  upstream dns_tcp_servers {\n    server [::1]:53;\n  }\n\n  server {\n    listen 853 ssl;\n    proxy_pass dns_tcp_servers;\n\n    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/nginx.ec.crt;\n    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/nginx.ec.key;\n\n    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/nginx.rsa.crt;\n    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/nginx.rsa.key;\n\n    ssl_handshake_timeout 30s;\n    ssl_session_cache shared:DNSTCP:50m;\n    ssl_session_tickets off;\n    ssl_session_timeout 1h;\n\n    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2;\n    ssl_ciphers 'ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256';\n    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;\n  }\n}\n\nThe SSL configuration is largely what Mozilla currently recommends for a\n'Modern' config. Any client that supports DNS-over-TLS is new enough that\nthey'll have access to modern queries. You'll need to put your key and\ncertificates in the appropriate locations for that config.\nWith that in place start up the server:\nsystemctl start nginx.service\nsystemctl enable nginx.service\n\nYou'll need to allow 953/tcp through your firewall and will likely need to\nmake changes to your SELinux policy to allow Nginx to listen on that port.\nI haven't found a good way to directly test the resolver using command line\nclients but by configuring my Android phone towards my server and temporarily\nadding the following to my unbound server config I can that queries being made\nand responded to appropriately:\nlog-queries: yes\nlog-replies: yes\n\nThe next steps are on you.

To stay connected with our other\nremote workers and the main office we keep a live video conference going all\nthe time. It's pretty convenient and definitely allows me to continue to feel\nconnected with the company.\nDuring one of our stand ups, a coworker mentioned that they'd like to see how\nthings looked over time. I have three 1440p monitors and largely leave the\nvideo conference on my right most window, which makes recording (an audio free)\ntimelapse pretty easy with FFmpeg.\nThere are a couple of stack overflow posts about this but I wanted to use VP9\n(really I wanted to use AV1, but it isn't well supported yet). This adds a bit\nof a trick as VP9 wants to analyze a bit of the video and will break if there\naren't enough frames so some additional options are needed to get it to work.\nThese are the settings that worked well for me:\nffmpeg -f x11grab -framerate 1 \\\n  -thread_queue_size 2048 -probesize 10M -analyzeduration 10M \\\n  -s 2560,1440 -i :1.0+5120,0 \\\n  -vf settb=\\(1/30\\),setpts=N/TB/30 -r 30 \\\n  -s 1280,720 -vcodec vp9 -crf 24 video_conference_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).mkv\n\nI organized the parameters so they could easily be explained on a line by line\nbasis. The first line captures the X11 render output (sorry wayland users,\nyou'll have to look elsewhere) with a framerate of 1/second.\nThe second line holds the parameters that tune the analyze phase for the low\nbandwidth and low framerate, these values are byte size not duration (10M is\n10Mb not 10 minutes).\nThat third line will likely need to be customized to your display setup. I\nwanted to capture the size of one of my monitors (-s 2560x1440) which is\npretty straight forward. Unusually, my X display is :1 (visible by printing\nthe $DISPLAY environment variable) instead of the normal :0. Finally,\nx11grab treats multi-monitor displays as one buffer, so to get my right most\nmonitor I have to add an X offset of the combined widths of my other two\nmonitors (that's the 5120,0).\nThis fourth line is kind of black magic, but ultimately it's adding some\nmetadata to the stream saying that the output will be 30fps, and don't complain\nthat the original framerate was 1fps.\nThe last line controls the output, I wanted to resize the video down to 720p\nwith a reasonable encode quality, using the VP9 codec I mentioned before, and\nstoring it with a date stamped file name.\nWhen your done recording just Ctrl-C out of it (and give it a few seconds, it\nmay seem like it hung while writing out the data).\nIf I was going to make a recommendation, you may want to speed this up to 60fps\ninstead of 30 as a full workday will be a tediously long 8 minute video to\nwatch.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2018/timelapse-of-a-linux-desktop/","title":"Timelapse of a Linux Desktop"},"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2018/weird-cloudflare-behavior/":{"body":"While working on a replacement webserver, I encountered some odd behavior which\ntook a bit to track down to CloudFlare.

While working through an issue in AWS I needed to\nunderstand how they handle public IP addressing. While this issue for me was\nspecific to an Elastic IP all of their public addresses are handled this way\nand may bite you even without them. The problems specifically crop up when a\nhosted piece of software does NAT traversal detection and changes it's behavior\nbased on the result.\nAmazon attaches public IP address to EC2 instances (and likely other of their\nhosted services) through 1:1 NAT mapping of external to internal addresses. All\ntraffic will reach your instance without issue, but your system's native\nnetworking stack will (by default) not become aware of what that public IP is.\nIn most cases this isn't an issue, the traffic ends up at your instance and is\nproperly changed to the internal address so your system responds without any\nadditional configuration work.\nThe first issue is tunneled traffic. I experienced this in my last post\nwith IPSec. The tunneled traffic is not modified by going through a 1:1 NAT and\nyour host will not recognize the external address inside the tunnel, which in\nmost cases will result in silently dropped packets (the \"oh this isn't for me\"\nsyndrome).\nThere are ways to get your system to respond to tunneled packets with other IP\naddresses such as treating it like a high-availability shared virtual server IP\naddress but I have yet to find a clean way to deal with responding to the\naddress. IPSec had a way to deal with this built in directly and I'd refer you\nback to my other post to read about that.\nUsually sniffing the tunneled traffic is enough to diagnose these issues.\nWhat is a bit more pernicious, is when a server changes its behavior when it\ndetects a NAT in place. This requires deeper understanding of the protocol in\nuse and in some cases the specific server implementation. Once again this post\nis ultimately about IPSec (and specifically libreswan).\nWhile you don't have to make any changes to get IPSec working with AWS public\nIPs it will detect the NAT and start encapsulating the traffic. The\nencapsulation will require an additional port being opened on your security\ngroup firewall but more importantly, it will add variable latency and\nadditional processing overhead to each packet. Not everything is sensitive to\nthis but you'll be needlessly adding overhead to your network traffic is you\ndon't address it. In my case (AWS VPC to AWS VPC) there aren't any meaningful\nNATs in place that require this encapsulation to function appropriately.\nIf you encounter this and are using libreswan on AWS you only need to add the\nfollowing two lines to your tunnel's config disable this behavior:\nencapsulation=no\nnat-keepalive=no\n\nI hope this helps someone else diagnose weird behavior when working with public\nIP addresses on AWS.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2019/aws-elastic-ip-details/","title":"AWS Elastic IP Details"},"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2019/blender-loop-select-in-cinnamon/":{"body":"I've recently been playing around with Blender (following this tutorial\nseries).

Nginx was running\nin an alpine container as a front end load balancer. It had a dynamic config\nthat got periodically updated by a sidecar, and had filebeat shipping logs out\nto a central collector but otherwise was just a very simple Nginx config.\nEvery now and then the container would crash, it would automatically recover\nfast enough no alarms were lost and the clients would just resend their\nrequests. No data was losts, everything failed gracefully, but it's still a\npretty crazy thing to leave happening.\nThere was nothing in the log besides some client errors and configuration\nreloading notifications. The external metrics showed the container throwing\nsome kind of memory party before finally burning out and crashing. It was a\npretty steady trend upwards indicative of some kind of a memory leak. The graph\nbelow illustrates this. Each of those drops is either the container crashing or\nme manually restarting it to test behavior. Can you figure out when I fixed the\nissue?\n\nTo figure out what was going on I had to get an invitation that container's\nparty.\nI don't think there is great tooling for inspecting individual processes inside\nof containers. As much as we'd like to think of containers as isolated\napplications, its not uncommon for them to run a minimal init container,\nor be composed of separate different processes themselves that handle different\nthings (Nginx has a master process and spawns off many worker processes). We\nstill need the data on those processes.\nThe common solution to getting this data seems to be to \"just exec into the\ncontainer\". In general exec should be restricted. If you find yourself\nrunning exec in a container, you're missing tooling or metrics that should\navoid that (which is the case here).\nDenying exec is probably a longer discussion but the short of it is: If you\ncan exec into the container, you can extract its secrets, configuration, and\naccess any services that it's allowed to (likely escalating your personal\nprivileges within the cluster). This is without considering the ramifications\nof exec'ing into a privileged container.\nIn any event, not all container clusters solution allow external execution\n(looking at you AWS ECS, its the one good thing I have to say about you).\nI chose to modify the container to log the data I needed instead. I setup a\nwrapper that started and backgrounded the following script:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nwhile [ 1 ]; do\n  # This generates a JSON output that can be pulled via the ECS logs of the top\n  # memory consuming processes using what we have available in alpine.\n  ps -o pid,time,rss,vsz,args |\n    tail -n +2 |\n    awk 'memstat: { print \"{\\\"pid\\\":\" $1 \",\\\"time\\\":\\\"\" $2 \"\\\",\\\"rss\\\":\" $3 \",\\\"vsz\\\":\" $4 \",\\\"cmd\\\":\\\"\" substr($0, index($0,$5)) \"\\\"}\" }'\n\n  sleep 300\ndone\n\nYes, I'm abusing awk to generate JSON I can parse later.\nEach message has a prefix of memstat: so I can easily filter and extract that\ndata from the live log stream. After a couple of hours (the time it generally\ntook for the party to get going) the issue was pretty obvious. Inside the\ncontainer there was a growing number of processes with the name nginx: worker process is shutting down. Some Googling turned up a post in the Nginx mailing\nlist from a while ago.\nThe responses claimed that it was the result of a third party module, but this\nis stock Nginx (version 1.15.8 at the time) which was at least three years\nolder than the post. It did indicate a clue though: config reloading.\nI don't know why Nginx believed connections were still open, we have request\nand connect timeouts both in this config and upstream. Some of these processes\nwere sticking around for hours (I never actually saw one exit after getting\ninto this hung state). Every config reload was dropping a zombie worker or two\ninto the container, permanently consuming ~30Mb of RAM. When it hit the\nconfigured threshold, the party gets stopped.\nAn option was added in the Nginx core module to handle situations where\nthe worker wouldn't close, but this definitely seems like a bug of some kind.\nThere is a newer version of Nginx (1.17.5 at the time of the writing) that\ncould very well have fixed this issue.\nAdding worker_shutdown_timeout 60s; to the main Nginx config solved the issue\n(60 seconds matches our request and connect timeouts so nothing valid should\nlast longer than that). Sure enough Nginx went back to stable, and predictably\nlow memory usage.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2019/fixing-hung-nginx-workers/","title":"Fixing Hung Nginx Workers"},"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2019/merging-overlapping-subnets/":{"body":"Once upon a time there was a single AWS account. In this AWS account was\nseveral regions but a single VPC. To make sure expansions into other regions\nwas possible this VPC chose to use the largest private subnet which just so\nhappened to also be the default (10.0.0.0/8).\nAnother AWS account enter the picture and while they were single they came to\nthe same conclusion and followed the best practices and defaults to their\nheart's content. Normally this wouldn't be a problem for either of them, but\nthey found each other and tied the knot and were happily together for the rest\nof time...\nBut in this story there is a darkness looming. Communication was not everything\neither of them desired. There were secret things that couldn't be said in\npublic forums of the internet but they both desperately wanted share. There was\na solution... But it involved dark magicks.\nI found myself in a situation where two AWS VPCs needed to communicate\nsensitive data between the two, but they were using overlapping IP address\nspaces. There was a lot of room available in both, but even some individual IPs\noverlapped and renumbering would prove problematic and time consuming.\nEventually these two VPCs were intended to be merged anyway, but business\nrequirements needed a basic level of communication sooner.\nThe solution I came up with may be useful for others in a pinch; Two layers of\n1:1 NAT were employed allowing each to communicate with what each side seemed\nto believe were unique IPs. To do this we need to have a usable IP address that\nwe can map into without potentially wrecking havoc on access to random sites on\nthe internet.\nI was lucky in that all the hosts that need to talk to each other had addresses\non both sides below 10.7.0.x. This is more addresses than are available to\nthe 192.168.0.0/16 private address space but covers only about 25% of the\n172.16.0.0/16 space. If you're in a worse situation where hosts are properly\nscattered all over the 10.0.0.0/8 address you can still use this technique\nbut it will require a bit more manual configuration mapping allocating either\n/24 to route or in the most extreme case individual host addresses.\nBefore we go any further, I definitely consider this technique to be a band-aid\nfor the issue. For longer term connectivity some form of migration should be\nplanned and executed on. This makes a GREAT and stable band-aid though.\nIf you'd like to follow along you'll need two VPCs, each with two EC2 instances\nto work as the tunnel hosts and likely two more to be test hosts to make use of\nthe tunnels.\nThis part is easy, we'll use CentOS 7 hosts as a base. You'll need to\nadditionally install the following software:\n\niptables-services\nlibreswan\ntcpdump (optional but invaluable to diagnose issues)\n\nIf you're not on AWS you'll also want to make sure that NetworkManager and\nfirewalld are both removed from the system. They will break the\nconfigurations you put in place if left to their own machinations. If you\nremove NetworkManager remember to enable the network service. For good measure\nhere is a minimal DHCP config you can use to configure eth0 on your system:\n# /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0\n\nDEVICE=\"eth0\"\nNM_CONTROLLED=\"no\"\nONBOOT=\"yes\"\nTYPE=\"Ethernet\"\n\nBOOTPROTO=\"dhcp\"\nIPV4_FAILURE_FATAL=\"yes\"\n\nLet's also start with a minimal IPTables ruleset. This is pretty close to the\ndefaults, but it's good to be sure that we're all on the same page:\n# /etc/sysconfig/iptables\n\n*nat\n:PREROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]\n:INPUT ACCEPT [0:0]\n:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]\n:POSTROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]\n\n# NAT rules will be added here\n\nCOMMIT\n\n*filter\n:INPUT DROP [0:0]\n:FORWARD DROP [0:0]\n:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]\n\n-A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT\n\n-A INPUT -m tcp -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT\n\n# Filter rules will be added here\n\n-A INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited\n-A FORWARD -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited\n\nCOMMIT\n\nPlace the contents of that file in /etc/sysconfig/iptables as the header\nindicates. The differences from the default are mostly in that we have also\ndefined the nat table and switched the default action on the INPUT and\nFORWARD chains to drop. Both the default and this one will reject the traffic\nanyways so this doesn't actually change the behavior of the firewall.\nDefining the nat table doesn't change any behavior either, but I'll be\nreferencing it later on in the post and you should add the rules where\nindicated by the comment. If you get confused by any of my instructions around\nadding the firewall rules, there is a complete ruleset at the end of the post\nyou can reference directly.\nFinally let's make sure the firewall is enabled and running:\nsystemctl enable iptables.service\nsystemctl start iptables.service\n\nBasic Connectivity\nFrom this point on it is going to become important to distinguish the two\nnetworks I'll be bridging. This method is very symmetric (all the firewalls and\nconfigs should effectively be the same on the two tunnel instances) but there\nare a few places where the remote IP and local IPs need to be referenced. Going\nforward I'm going to refer to the two networks as east and west but these\nare arbitrary labels.\nYou'll need to collect the public IP from the AWS console for your tunnel hosts\nin both the east and west. For me I'm going to use 5.5.5.5 for the west\nIP and 7.7.7.7 for the east IP. If you see these in the configs you'll want\nto replace them with the appropriate values for your networks. If you expect\nthis to last a long time or will be a business critical tunnel I highly\nrecommend using an Elastic IP on each of these hosts.\nYou'll need to setup a dedicated security group for each of the tunnel hosts.\nTo avoid bouncing back and forth between these the security groups as we\nprogress through the guide I'm going to put all the rules we're going to need\nin the following table. These are inbound rules only and can be hardened a bit\n(but I'll get to that later), let's focus on getting this up and running first.\nTypeProtocolPort RangeSourceDescription\nSSHTCP220.0.0.0/0SSH Access\nCustom ProtocolESP (50)All{other public IP}/32IPSec Encapsulated Packets\nCustom UDP RuleUDP500{other public IP}/32IPSec Key Management\nCustom ICMP Rule - IPv4Echo RequestN/A0.0.0.0/0Connectivity Checking\nAll TCPTCP0-6553510.0.0.0/8Internal TCP Traffic\nAll UDPUDP0-6553510.0.0.0/8Internal UDP Traffic\n\nYou'll want to replace {other public IP} with the public IP of the tunnel\nhost in the opposite network. For example if this is the security group for the\nwest tunnel host, you'd be allowing the traffic from 7.7.7.7.\nIf you're doing this in another environment you may also need UDP/4500 from\nthe other public IP when NAT traversal is required. AWS EC2 instances are NAT'd\nbut we can work around that and will include that later on.\nWith the security groups in place, and the local firewalls configured make sure\neach host can ping each other. If they can great! If not, double check all the\nIPs, security group rules, and iptables rules all match what I have documented\nhere.\nThe IPSec Tunnel\nThis tunnel provides strong authentication and encryption for all the traffic\nthat will be exchanged between the two networks. We've already installed the\nrequired packages we just need to configure the various pieces to get it\nrunning.\nFirst let's handle the firewall. In the /etc/sysconfig/iptables file we\nstandardized on earlier we need to add a couple of rules to each tunnel host\nfor the IPSec traffic. Add these just after the note for adding filter rules\nand before the REJECT rules:\n-A INPUT -p esp -j ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -m udp -p udp --sport 500 --dport 500 -j ACCEPT\n#-A INPUT -m udp -p udp --sport 4500 --dport 4500 -j ACCEPT\n\nThis will allow tunneled packets and key exchange through the firewall. If\nyou're not on AWS when setting this up you may need to uncomment that third\nrule for NAT traversal packets.\nThese rules are pretty unrestricted, but we have already narrowed down who will\nbe able to connect using the security group for these machines. By leaving a\nmore refined specification out of our definition here our IPTables rules can\nremain symmetric on both hosts making automated management through a devops\ntool simpler.\nNext up there are some specific sysctl settings that need to be adjusted for\nthe tunneled packets to not be rejected by the kernel. The reason behind the\nsysctl settings is pretty well documented on LibreSwan's FAQ if you're\ncurious for why they're needed.\nYou'll want to append the following to /etc/sysctl.conf on both tunnel hosts:\nnet.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects = 0\nnet.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects = 0\nnet.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 0\nnet.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0\nnet.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0\nnet.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 0\n\n# Annoyingly, this seems to ignore the defaults set above. This should be\n# interface that libreswan will be receiving the IPSec connections on\nnet.ipv4.conf.eth0.rp_filter = 0\n\nWith that in place run sysctl -p to apply the new settings and systemctl restart iptables.service to update the firewall rules.\nWe'll quickly do a global IPSec config to make sure we're on the same page.\nReplace the contents of /etc/ipsec.conf on each tunnel host with the\nfollowing:\n# /etc/ipsec.conf\n\nconfig setup\n  protostack=netkey\n\ninclude /etc/ipsec.d/*.conf\n\nIPSec has a couple of ways of handling authentication. The most secure is\nasymmetric encryption using RSA keys which requires each host to have a private\nkey and knowledge of the other host's public key. To these keys on each tunnel\nhost run the following commands:\nsudo ipsec initnss\nsudo ipsec newhostkey --output /etc/ipsec.secrets\n\nSimilar to our west and east analogy, IPSec has the concept of left and\nright hosts on either side of a tunnel. We're going to map them the same way\nbut need to get the public keys of each host first so they can verify each\nother.\nOn our west host, which will be our left host for the IPSec config retrieve\nthe public key with the following two commands. The output will be one very\nlong line that begins with leftrsasigkey= record this entire output.\nCKAID=\"$(sudo ipsec showhostkey --list | head -n 1 | awk '{ print $NF }')\"\nsudo ipsec showhostkey --left --ckaid ${CKAID} | tail -n 1\n\nA bit of an explanation of those two commands. The first one extracts the\nunique key identifier for the first key present (there shouldn't be any\nothers), while the second gets the actual public key for that identifier. We'll\nneed to repeat the process on our east host slightly modified which will be\nour right host:\nCKAID=\"$(sudo ipsec showhostkey --list | head -n 1 | awk '{ print $NF }')\"\nsudo ipsec showhostkey --right --ckaid ${CKAID} | tail -n 1\n\nThis will also output another long line that this time will begin with\nrightrsasigkey= which you should also record. On both hosts you'll want to\nplace the following IPSec tunnel config at /etc/ipsec.d/vpc-link-tunnel.conf:\nconn vpc-link-tunnel\n  auto=start\n  pfs=yes\n  type=transport\n\n  leftid=@west_tunnel_server\n  rightid=@east_tunnel_server\n  left={west external ip}\n  right={east external ip}\n\n  authby=rsasig\n  leftrsasigkey={left/west sig key}\n  rightrsasigkey={right/east sig key}\n\nBe sure to replace the {west external ip} with the external IP address of our\nwest server and likewise the {east external ip} with the external IP\naddress of our east server. Be sure to replace the last two lines with the\noutput of the two keys we got from our west and east tunnel hosts.\nThat's it for the IPSec configuration, let's start the daemon up and verify\nthat it's working on both tunnel servers:\nsudo systemctl enable ipsec.service\nsudo systemctl start ipsec.service\n\nLet's check the IPSec status to make sure it's happy:\nsudo ipsec status\n\nThere will be quite a bit of output but what you're looking for is a line that\nlooks like this:\n000 Total IPsec connections: loaded 1, active 1\n\nIf the loaded count is 0, double check the presence and file names as well as\nthe global config. If you've properly loaded the config but it isn't coming up\nas active, review the contents of /var/log/secure for any IPSec error\nmessages. If there is an authentication error, most likely the public keys got\ncopied incorrectly. Make sure that both keys exist in both configs and match\nthe outputs from the key extraction commands earlier on.\nIf there are connection issues there are quite a few other bits that could have\ngone wrong. Review the firewalls, security groups, and IPSec configs to make\nsure the addresses are correct and the protocols are allowed through.\nOnce the details have been worked out and the tunnel is up, all the traffic\nbetween the two hosts should now be encrypted. This can be verified using\ntcpdump and sending a couple pings at the other host. When IPSec is flowing\nthe traffic will look something along the lines of:\n21:51:02.807688 IP 10.0.1.156 &gt; 7.7.7.7: ESP(spi=0x171f19e9,seq=0xe), length 116\n\nMake sure this is working, everything beyond this depends on the IPSec tunnel\nup and running correctly.\nThe GRE Tunnel\nThe GRE overlay isn't required for this to work and does add 24 bytes of\noverhead to each packet but it provides us some benefits.\nThe first and probably most important is that each end will have a fixed\nprivate IP address as it's routing target. If the GRE tunnel is down for any\nreason the tunnel host won't attempt to send any forwarded traffic to a public\nIP address. This provides a layer of security against other misconfigurations.\nSince all of the traffic will only be routed to the tunnel endpoint if the GRE\ntunnel is up and will always travel over the GRE tunnel we can simplify our\nfirewall policy around enforcement of encrypted traffic. If we guarantee all\nGRE traffic is encrypted over the IPSec tunnel, all traffic using the GRE\ntunnel will be encrypted with only a single universal firewall rule.\nOne final benefit with the firewall is that we get a separate interface we can\nuse to identify the direction traffic is traveling through our tunnels without\nworrying about the details of IP addresses (which will be changing in unusual\nways later on).\nIf these benefits don't justify the 24 byte per packet overhead to you, you're\nwelcome to skip this section but you'll need to figure out the changes to the\nfirewall rules and routing tables on your own later on.\nLet's start the setup with a safety net. We need to allow the GRE traffic\nthrough the firewall on the tunnel hosts, but we want to make sure that we only\npass if it has been properly encrypted with the IPSec. We can use the iptables\npolicy module. Add the following rules to the filter section of each of our\nfirewalls:\n-A INPUT -m policy --dir in --pol ipsec --proto esp -p gre -j ACCEPT\n-A OUTPUT -m policy --dir out --pol ipsec --proto esp -p gre -j ACCEPT\n-A OUTPUT -p gre -j DROP\n\nThese three lines are all that is required to enforce that all of our traffic\nbeing routed between the two networks will always be encrypted if they have any\nhope of making it.\nRestart the firewall so the change can take effect:\nsudo systemctl restart iptables.service\n\nConfiguring a GRE tunnel on a CentOS box is very simple on each host create a\nnew file /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-tun0 with the following\ncontents:\n# /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-tun0\n\nDEVICE=tun0\nBOOTPROTO=none\nONBOOT=yes\nTYPE=GRE\n\nMY_INNER_IPADDR=10.255.254.1\n#MY_OUTER_IPADDR={current side external IP}\n\nPEER_INNER_IPADDR=10.255.254.2\nPEER_OUTER_IPADDR={opposing side external IP}\n\n# Not needed since we only have one tunnel. Can be any 32 bit numerical value\n#KEY=12345678\nEOF\n\nFor completeness I've included MY_OUTER_IPADDR and KEY commented out as\nthey may be useful for other GRE tunnels but not necessary for this one. For\nthe west server {current side external IP} should be replaced by the west\ntunnel server's external IP and {opposing side external IP} with the east\ntunnel server's external IP. Reverse the settings on the east tunnel server.\nOn each tunnel host bring the tunnel up:\nsudo ifup tun0\n\nThe state of the tunnel can be checked with sudo ip addr show tun0 which will\nhave an output similar to the following:\n5: tun0@NONE: &lt;POINTOPOINT,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 8977 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000\n    link/gre 0.0.0.0 peer 7.7.7.7\n    inet 10.255.254.1 peer 10.255.254.2/32 scope global tun0\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n\nYou're specifically looking for the UP and LOWER_UP flags. You can double\ncheck the tunnel is functioning by pinging 10.255.254.1 and 10.255.254.2\nfrom the east and west tunnel host respectively.\nWe now have a private encrypted layer 2 tunnel between the two VPC tunnel\nhosts, next up is to get other traffic in the VPC passing across the tunnel.\nTunnel Host Routing and Rewriting\nUp to this point everything has been setting up pretty standard tunnels between\nLinux hosts. This is where the magic needs to start happening. Each network\nneeds to see the other network with a different IP space. I've already\ndiscussed that I'll be using 172.16.0.0/12 as our mapping network.\nSince we're going to start forwarding traffic between networks we need to\nenable it in the kernel. On both tunnel hosts the following line needs to be\nadded to /etc/sysctl.conf and sysctl -p run again to apply the change:\nnet.ipv4.ip_forward = 1\n\nWe need to ensure each tunnel server routes our mapping network to the other\none. This should be added / removed based on the status of our GRE tunnel so\nwe'll add it as a static route in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-tun0.\nFor our west tunnel server the contents of the file should be:\n172.16.0.0/12 via 10.255.254.2\n\nFor our east tunnel server the contents of the file should be:\n172.16.0.0/12 via 10.255.254.1\n\nRestart the network (again dealing with a minor disruption) and check the\nrouting table with the following commands:\nsudo systemctl restart network.service\nsudo ip -4 route\n\nYou should see the new route present in the routing table, but now we have a\nproblem. If the firewalls allowed us to forward traffic right now, any traffic\neither tunnel host received with a destination of 172.16.0.0/12 would ping\npong back and forth across the tunnel until it's TTL expired. This would end up\nbeing a nasty traffic amplification issue if we allowed it.\nHandling this requires us to rewrite the packet destination received from the\ntunnel to the VPC's network before the kernel can make a routing decision on\nit and thus we use our first firewall incantation in the nat table. On each\ntunnel host add the following rule:\n-A PREROUTING -i tun0 -d 172.16.0.0/12 -j NETMAP --to 10.0.0.0/12\n\nSide note: It's not documented very well but when the NETMAP is used in the\nPREROUTING chain it only effects the destination network. When used in the\nPOSTROUTING chain it only effects the source address (which we'll make use of\nlater).\nWhile we're updating our firewall we should also allow our forwarded traffic.\nThe following two rules need to be added to the filter section of each tunnel\nhost:\n-A FORWARD -i eth0 -o tun0 -s 10.0.0.0/12 -d 172.16.0.0/12 -j ACCEPT\n-A FORWARD -i tun0 -o eth0 -s 172.16.0.0/12 -d 10.0.0.0/12 -j ACCEPT\n\nYou may notice that I'm specifying 10.0.0.0/12 instead of 10.0.0.0/8. This\nis a limitation I mentioned at the beginning of this article which worked in my\ninstance. You can't uniquely map a larger network into a smaller network. If\nyour hosts are more scattered this is where you'll need to start duplicating\nrules and using smaller subnet masks for targeted groups of hosts. There will\nbe other rules coming up shortly you'll need to update as well.\nAs part of this our rules won't forward traffic coming from our tunnel hosts\nsubnet of 10.255.254.0/30 as it is way outside of 10.0.0.0/12. Simply\nallowing this subnet won't allow us to receive the responses to any traffic\nleaving our tunnel hosts for the opposite network as the source address will\nappear local to the VPC. We can reserve two more addresses within the range of\n172.16.0.0/12 to work as our tunnel endpoints. This isn't strictly necessary\nif you really need the two addresses but they make diagnostics significantly\nsimpler.\nWe can map our two addresses appropriately using the fixed 1:1 NAT mapping in\nthe kernel by adding the following rules in the nat section of each tunnel\nhosts firewall:\n-A PREROUTING -i tun0 -d 172.31.254.1 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.255.254.1\n-A PREROUTING -i tun0 -d 172.31.254.2 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.255.254.2\n\n-A POSTROUTING -o tun0 -d 10.255.254.1 -j SNAT --to-source 172.31.254.1\n-A POSTROUTING -o tun0 -d 10.255.254.2 -j SNAT --to-source 172.31.254.2\n\nOnly half of these rules apply to each tunnel host, but it doesn't hurt having\nboth sets on both hosts and it keeps us symmetrical. You should be able to ping\neach of the tunnel hosts equivalent 172.31.254.0/30 address at this point (if\nyou restart the firewall).\nRight now if a client host added a route pointing at either of the tunnel host\nfor the mapped network it would make it out the opposite tunnel host's eth0\ninterface but it would still have a 10.0.0.0/12 source address and the packet\nwould never return to the tunnel host, much less the host on the other network.\nThis is a bit tricky as we only want to rewrite the source address (requiring a\nPOSTROUTING rule) but only want it to effect mapped traffic addresses coming\nin from a normal VPC network, and POSTROUTING can't match on source\ninterface. We want to handle this rewriting before any other changes have\noccurred which requires us to do the source address rewriting happen on the\nsource tunnel host.\nTo handle this we can use a combination of traffic markers and our handy\nNETMAP target. On both of the tunnel hosts add the following two rules to the\nnat section:\n-A PREROUTING -i tun0 -d 172.16.0.0/12 -s 10.0.0.0/12 -j MARK --set-mark 0x01\n-A POSTROUTING -o tun0 -m mark --mark 0x01 -s 10.0.0.0/12 -j NETMAP --to 172.16.0.0/12\n\nLet's restart the firewall again to make sure all the rules have been properly\napplied:\nsudo systemctl restart iptables.service\n\nThat's the last of the changes we need to make to the tunnel hosts, now the\nother hosts need to learn how to send their traffic to the other side...\nVPC Routing\nHosts inside a VPC will directly send traffic to any other host within it's\ndefined network. For networks beyond their VPC subnet (such as our\n172.16.0.0/12) network will send their traffic to their default gateway which\nis the VPC router. These routers are configurable within the AWS web console by\ngoing to the VPC section, finding the relevant VPC you're using and clicking\non the link to your Main Route Table.\nUnder the Routes sub-tab on the selected Route Table, click on the Edit routes button. Add 172.16.0.0/12 as a destination to the routes. Click on\nthe Target drop down, choose Instance and find your VPC tunnel host in the\nlist. Click Save Routes and allow a minute or two for the route to update.\nThere is a sneaky potential issue here. If you've gone and done some deep\ncustomization to your VPC, you may have created and specified additional route\ntables for specific subnets. You'll want to evaluate each of the potential\nroute tables and add the same route to each one.\nThere is one final thing generally stopping our traffic from flowing freely. By\ndefault every single EC2 instance drops any traffic that reaches an EC2\ninstance with a source or destination address that doesn't match the IP that\nhas been assigned to that instance. This is generally a very useful protection,\nbut we'll be shooting out packets with source addresses in the 172.16.0.0/12\nrange so need to disable this protection on each of tunnel hosts.\nFind your tunnel host in the list of your EC2 instances. Right click on the\ninstance, go to the Networking sub-menu, and choose Change Source/Dest. Check. It will pop up a confirmation, confirm it by clicking on Yes, Disable.\nNow the only thing preventing hosts in each VPC from talking to each other is\ntheir respective inbound security groups but the traffic should flow freely.\nWe're effectively done and everything should be happy.\nIt may not be immediately obvious but you will have to do some math to convert\nthe IP addresses of the remote subnet into the mapping network. Specifically\nyou'll need to replace the first octet (10) with the mapping network's first\noctet (172), then add 16 to the second octet. If the resulting second octet\nis greater than 31 it won't be able to traverse the network. The remaining\ntwo octets are left unchanged.\nSome examples of what this translation looks like:\n\n10.0.0.2 becomes 172.16.0.2\n10.4.1.80 becomes 172.20.1.80\n10.30.56.100 becomes 172.46.56.100 and is unroutable\n\nNo matter which side of the tunnel you're on the other side's addresses will\nalways be mapped this way.\nHardening\nWe have some fairly wide open firewall rules for passing traffic on the\ntunneling hosts themselves and in the security groups on them. These can\ncertainly be tightened further and I'll even cover some situations in a bit\nabout when you might want to do that. As it stands right now the internal\nprivate IP addresses of the tunnel host's and clients haven't matter beyond\nwhether or not they were in the routable range.\nIf you use ephemeral containers or autoscaling IP addresses are going to change\nfrequently. To harden the rules on the tunnel hosts themselves would need to be\nupdated whenever these addresses change which removes a lot of benefits. Since\nwe're already using a dedicated security group for our tunnel hosts, we can\ninstead have other security groups reference it directly.\nTo allow traffic from the opposite VPC side, allow the relevant port's traffic\nfrom the tunnel host's security group and bam problem solved. This is still\nsomewhat course granularity of firewalling as you are effectively granting the\nentire other VPC access to that service port. In a lot of cases that will be\nenough and additional network controls such as inter-service authentication\nwill be sufficient to mitigating additional issues.\nIf you do need finer granularity you can start by limiting traffic on the VPC\ntunnel's inbound security group from the opposite side. If that is not fine\ngrained enough you can eventually resort to firewall rules in the FORWARD\nchain itself.\nThere is one additional benefit of putting the rules in the forward chain if\nyour addresses are sufficiently static to deploy rules through it. With\nsecurity groups alone, the traffic will traverse the tunnel before being\ndropped by the opposing side's security group. Likely your service will retry\nthe connection. These little bits of traffic do add up and will take time.\nIf you instead firewall with reject packets as they enter the tunnel, a service\nwill get immediate feedback the traffic won't flow. No additional bandwidth is\nwasted and the latency will be very small. You can also log these packets with\na LOG target before rejecting them so you can audit and diagnose traffic that\ndoesn't make it through the tunnel.\nFor those reasons I do prefer to firewall at the tunnel hosts themselves for\nsufficiently static services.\nTroubleshooting\nI've tried to include basic diagnostics for each piece that we've built up but\nif you're still having issues getting traffic flowing here is a checklist to\nlook over that might help diagnose the source of the issue:\n\nRestart the tunnel host's network\nVerify the tunnel host's firewalls match the final reference firewall below\nRestart the tunnel host's firewalls\nMake sure each tunnel host can ping the other one\nEnsure libreswan service is up and running (/var/log/secure will have\nany errors it encounters if the tunnel isn't coming up\nVerify the GRE tunnel is up by pinging the other end's tunnel IP\nCheck the routing table on both tunnel hosts\nEnsure source and destination hosts are within the 10.0.0.0/12 range\nMake sure the source / destination checking is disabled on the tunnel host's\nEC2 instances\nCheck to make sure the VPC routing tables include 172.16.0.0/12 pointing at\nthe tunnel hosts in both networks.\nCheck the relevant security groups to make sure all other traffic is allowed\nto/from the tunnel hosts in each security group\n\nIf all else fails sniff the traffic on the interfaces you expect for the\npackets in each place to make sure they're going where you expect. Usually this\nmakes it pretty clear to me whether packets are even getting to the tunnel\nhosts and which interface they either stop or aren't being manipulated at.\nConclusion\nThis post was quite a wild ride for me to write up and is probably my longest\npost to date. If you've made it this far I'm incredibly flattered. I hope this\nhelps other people out there and I would especially love to hear from anyone\nthat makes use of this information or finds an issue with anything in the post.\nEither send me an email or open an issue for my website's public\nrepository.

When this happens you can only flash the filesystem using the\nXMODEM serial console. This is a fairly well documented process on Windows. On\nLinux most of the documented ways involve switching between multiple utilities\nand can be tricky. I wanted to documented how I did this and possibly help\nother in the same situation.\nI'm doing this on Fedora, but the only thing specific to Fedora is installing\nthe packages which can be done with the following command (and are pretty\nstandard names):\ndnf install lrzsz screen -y\n\nFrom an external perspective the switch was rapidly blinking it's SYST light\nwith all of the other lights off. I connected up a console cable, the serial\nport showed up as /dev/ttyUSB0. We'll connect to the serial port using screen\nwith the following command:\nsudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 9600\n\nPower cycling the switch gets you the boot messages that show us the issue:\nUsing driver version 1 for media type 1\nBase ethernet MAC Address: xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx\nXmodem file system is available.\nThe password-recovery mechanism is enabled.\nInitializing Flash...\nmifs[2]: 0 files, 1 directories\nmifs[2]: Total bytes     :    3870720\nmifs[2]: Bytes used      :       1024\nmifs[2]: Bytes available :    3869696\nmifs[2]: mifs fsck took 0 seconds.\nmifs[3]: 0 files, 1 directories\nmifs[3]: Total bytes     :   27998208\nmifs[3]: Bytes used      :       1024\nmifs[3]: Bytes available :   27997184\nmifs[3]: mifs fsck took 1 seconds.\n...done Initializing Flash.\ndone.\nLoading \"flash:/c3750-ipservicesk9-mz-15.0-2_SE10a.bin\"...flash:/c3750-ipservicesk9-mz-15.0-2_SE10a.bin: no such file or directory\n\nError loading \"flash:/c3750-ipservicesk9-mz-15.0-2_SE10a.bin\"\n\nInterrupt within 5 seconds to abort boot process.\nBoot process failed...\n\nThe system is unable to boot automatically.

We need to initialize it with the\nflash_init command which will allow us access to the flash again:\nswitch: flash_init\nInitializing Flash...\nflashfs[0]: 0 files, 1 directories\nflashfs[0]: 0 orphaned files, 0 orphaned directories\nflashfs[0]: Total bytes: 32514048\nflashfs[0]: Bytes used: 1024\nflashfs[0]: Bytes available: 32513024\nflashfs[0]: flashfs fsck took 6 seconds.\n...done Initializing Flash.\n\nswitch: dir flash:/\nDirectory of flash://\n\n\n32513024 bytes available (1024 bytes used)\n\nswitch:\n\nDefinitely nothing present. At this point we need to use XMODEM to get the\nfirmware file. You'll need to use your support contract to get the latest\nfirmware for your model of switch. I made sure this file was in my current\ndirectory (saves some time in a bit). For me this file was named\nc3750-ipservicesk9-mz.150-2.SE10a.bin you'll want to replace this with the\nappropriate filename you pull yourself. Right, carrying on.\nXMODEM is a very slow process especially when we use the default speed of 9600\nbaud. We can speed this process up by 12x by adjusting the baud rate. You can\nskip this bit though if you're willing to wait several hours for the file to\ntransfer.\nTo speed up the baud rate execute the following command, be aware that your\nterminal is expected to immediately become responsive and this is fine:\nswitch: set BAUD 115200\n\nKill the screen session by pressing Ctrl-a quickly following by a lone k.\nIt will prompt you to confirm exiting the session, do so with y and start a\nnew session with the higher baud rate:\nsudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200\n\nPress return and you'll get back to the switch prompt. This next bit is tricky\nas there is about a ten second timeout between starting the copy command and\nneeding to being the transfer. If you don't quite make it I've got a tip after\nthe command below:\nswitch: copy xmodem:/ flash:/c3750-ipservicesk9-mz.150-2.SE10a.bin\n\nQuick press Ctrl-a followed by :. In the prompt that shows up type in the\nfollowing:\nexec !! sx -b -X c3750-ipservicesk9-mz.150-2.SE10a.bin\n\nIf you get an error, it reports as cancelled, it times out just try again. This\ntime though after pressing Ctrl-a and : you can press your up arrow to\nbring up the last run command. Assuming you typed it in correctly this should\ngive you enough time to start the transfer. It will show you the progress of\nthe transfer which depending on size will take between twenty and thirty\nminutes (or hours if you didn't update the baud rate).\nSite note: One of the benefits of performing the sx command through screen is\nthat if anything happens to your terminal the transfer will continue. This was\nparticularly important for me at the time as I found myself SSH'd into a laptop\nfar away from myself over an unstable and shared cell connection running these\ncommands.\nWhen it's complete you're going to want to ensure the BOOT variable properly\nmatches the filename you just transferred:\nset BOOT flash:/c3750-ipservicesk9-mz.150-2.SE10a.bin\n\nWe're going to reset the baud rate back to normal (skip this if you didn't\nupdate your baud rate) which will cause you to loose the connection again:\nunset BAUD\n\nDisconnect as we did before and reconnect at the 9600 rate. One final command\nshould start the switch and get you back into the good graces of the Cisco CLI:\nswitch: boot\n\nOne final tip, if you want to access the boot menu of the switch I had a hell\nof a time trying to figure out how to actually send the break command to\ninterrupt the boot menu. None of the recommended combinations of Ctrl, Alt,\nShift, b, Break, and Scroll Lock. You can instead press the Mode\nbutton on the front of the switch to emulate this break key.\nCheers friends. Hope this helps another CLI adventurer.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2019/reflashing-cisco-catalyst-with-xmodem/","title":"Reflashing Cisco Catalyst With XMODEM"},"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2020/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2020/","title":""},"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/2020/extracting-dracut-built-initramfs/":{"body":"It's been a hot second since I've dived into the lands of initramfs and since\nthen it seems like things have gotten more complicated. This is the way of\nthings in tech and usually has a good reason. The simple way that used to work\nwonders (and is still required) to start with, was to identify if the file is\ncompressed:\n$ file /boot/initramfs-current.img\n/boot/initramfs-current.img: ASCII cpio archive (SVR4 with no CRC)\n\nIn this case the file appears to be entirely uncompressed which is convenient\nand likely exactly what you'll experience for reasons I'm about to get to. This\ncould indicate that there is a type of compression in place (such as gzip or\nthe like) in which case your initramfs has likely not been generated by a\nmodern version of Dracut and this post isn't right for you.\nNext let's extract the contents into a new temporary directory:\n$ mkdir init_tmp\n$ cd init_tmp\n$ cpio -mvid &lt; /boot/initramfs-current.img\n.\nearly_cpio\nkernel\nkernel/x86\nkernel/x86/microcode\nkernel/x86/microcode/AuthenticAMD.bin\n62 blocks\n\nThis is where things got weird and I got caught up. No /init? No tools for\ndealing with LVM, filesystems, device scanning? No core system directories like\n/dev, /sys, or /proc? What is going on here. We can also quickly see the\nsize doesn't match what we extracted:\n$ du --max-depth=1 -h\n32K     ./kernel\n36K     .\n$ ls -lh /boot/initramfs-current.img\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 13M Feb 18 15:13 /boot/initramfs-current.img\n\nTurns out this is an early optimization by dracut to get updated microcode to\nthe processor before we pass control over to any userspace programs. It's\nactually pretty slick and I'll have to figure out how this works in some future\npost. To get to the real initramfs we simply need to skip the first one using\ndd.\nPreviosly when we extracted the CPIO archive it told us how large it was (The\n62 blocks at the end). We simply need to skip those then we should be able to\ndecode the inner archive.\nSide note for clarity with the following commands, I switched back to my home\ndirectory and emptied out the extracted contents of the init_tmp directory we\ncreated earlier as that's where we want to put the extracted inner initramfs\ncontents.\n$ dd if=/boot/initramfs-current.img bs=512 skip=62 of=inner-initramfs-current.img\n25995+1 records in\n25995+1 records out\n13309841 bytes (13 MB, 13 MiB) copied, 0.0848529 s, 157 MB/s\n\nOnce again we need to identify if compression is present:\n$ file inner-initramfs-current.img\ninner-initramfs-current.img: LZ4 compressed data (v0.1-v0.9)\n\nFrom here we can decompress it and extract the inner archive much like before\nusing the appropriate utility (lz4cat does the trick here, your compression may\nvary).\n$ cd init_tmp\n$ lz4cat ../inner-initramfs-current.img | cpio -mvid\n.\nbin\nbin/bash\nbin/cat\nbin/chown\nbin/chroot\n...&lt;contents remove for brevity&gt;\nvar\nvar/lock\nvar/run\nvar/tmp\n54581 blocks\n\nBam! That is a lot more like it. I'm really curious how the kernel boot process\nworks with that early microcode but this got me where I needed to be and I hope\nthis helps someone else out.\nAdditional note: I missed this but apparently dracut ships with a utility\ncalled skipcpio which you can pipe one of these initramfs files through to\nskip the extra dd step.
