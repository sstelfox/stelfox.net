      <h1>Fail2Ban</h1>

<p>fail2ban provides a vital service of blocking troublesome IPs from attempting
brute force logins.</p>

<p>My immediate issue is that it requires a few packages off the bat that I do not
want on my system. Specifically tcpwrappers and shorewall. My firewall scripts
are stronger, easier to use, and IMHO more secure than what shorewall provides
and I don&#39;t need it. Neither does the fail2ban package as indicated in <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=244275">this
ticket</a> on the redhat bug tracker.</p>

<p>TODO: <a href="../mysql/">MySQL</a> logs now that the documented configuration logs authorization
failures.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>So what&#39;s my solution? Fuck the man we&#39;re doing this my way. Regular install
through yum, force the old packages out using rpm, and exclude fail2ban from
updating (and preventing those damn packages from coming back). This is done
using the following commands:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>[root@localhost ~]# yum install fail2ban -y
[root@localhost ~]# rpm -v --nodeps -e shorewall tcp_wrappers
</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Finally add this line to <code>/etc/yum.conf</code>.</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>exclude=fail2ban shorewall tcp_wrappers
</pre></div>
</div>

<p>There are of course security implication too not updating a package (in this
case fail2ban won&#39;t ever get updated) however it&#39;s an exception that I&#39;m
willing to make to get fail2ban and not have the shitty shittiness of shorewall
and tcp_wrappers on my systems.</p>

<h2>Firewall Modifications</h2>

<p>There are some small changes that need to be made to the firewall script that
should probably be merged with the default as they can&#39;t hurt and having
fail2ban easily available to my default config would be a significant benefit.</p>

<p>The changes are specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add an &quot;OFFENDINGIPS&quot; chain</li>
<li>Push all incoming traffic through the OFFENDINGIPS chain before continuing
through the INPUT chain</li>
<li>Add a rule to the OFFENDINGIPS chain to prevent ongoing attacks from getting
through for the duration of the attack</li>
</ul>

<p>The chain definition (near the top) should look like this:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>:OFFENDINGIPS - [0:0]
</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Push all the traffic through the chain looks like this (this belongs above all other INPUT chain rules):</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre># [DEF-RULESET] Pass all traffic through the OFFENDINGIPS table to block
# any hosts that have been caught being malicious in some way
-A INPUT -j OFFENDINGIPS
</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Rule to prevent ongoing attacks:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre># [DEF-RULESET] If something keeps trying to connect after we have marked
# them as an attacker, keep blocking them until they stop for a full hour.
# When fail2ban is adding IPs to this table, it will initially mark them
# as an ATTACKER and they will be banned for a minimum of the fail2ban time,
# but it will be indefinite as long as they keep trying 
-A OFFENDINGIPS -m recent --name ATTACKER --update --seconds 3600 -j DROP
</pre></div>
</div>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed that the documentation on the actual raw config files for fail2ban
is really poor. Most of the documentation I&#39;ve found is drop in files for
specific services but completely unable to find coherent documentation on all
the options in the actions files. Sure signs of amateur work which disheartens
me. This package is still useful though...</p>

<h3>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/asterisk.conf</h3>

<p>This file required a bit of special attention, I noticed that the one set of
regular expressions that have been copied and pasted everywhere DIDN&#39;T MATCH
actual logs. They didn&#39;t take into account the port, and frankly I like
matching the whole line rather than just part of it. I modified the expressions
which are now below. They are perfectly backwards compatible with older
versions of asterisk that may not include the port and as a bonus will match
against syslog output if you are logging to syslog as well.</p>

<p>Some notes on this specific file. I found &#39;pre-made&#39; asterisk configurations
for fail2ban on the internet and found them to be very lacking. The did not
deal with an attack log I saw actually hitting my server the &#39;Sending fake
auth rejection&#39; log specifically.</p>

<p>I was also greatly displeased by their performance. By making the regular
expression more specific (without sacrificing positive matches) I was able to
get a real world performance increase of 442%.</p>

<p>This was measured using the unix &#39;time&#39; program and fail2ban&#39;s regular
expression tester &#39;fail2ban-regex&#39;. As an example with one rule (the &#39;No
matching peer found&#39; log) turned on in each test, first the old than my updated
one gave the following results:</p>

<h2>Testing Matches/Regexes/Bans Without Making the System Live</h2>

<h3>Validation Configuration</h3>

<p>Using the following command you can verify that the configuration is valid and
that fail2ban will be happy with what you told it. It&#39;s output isn&#39;t very
friendly but it&#39;ll do in a pinch.</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>[root@localhost ~]# fail2ban-client -d
</pre></div>
</div>

<h3>Validation Regular Expressions</h3>

<p>First off you&#39;ll need a sample of the log that your going to be matching
against. If the message is already in your log more power to you, you can use
that logfile as the input (and it&#39;s what I did).</p>

<p>As for the regex, the tool supports passing the full thing on the command line
HOWEVER it doesn&#39;t expand fail2ban REGEX variables beyond <HOST> (that is those
defined in the common.conf file) which means you won&#39;t get an accurate
representation on a match.</p>

<p>The best way is to define the regex in a filter file for fail2ban and run the
tool like so (This is from me testing asterisk with the output from my test):</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>[root@localhost ~]# fail2ban-regex /var/log/asterisk.log /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/asterisk.conf
