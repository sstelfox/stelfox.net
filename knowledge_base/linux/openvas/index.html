<p>Install the packages <code>nikto</code>, <code>openvas-scanner</code>, <code>openvas-manager</code>, and
<code>openvas-client</code>.</p>

<h2>Scanner</h2>

<p>As root run openvas-mkcert like the following:</p>

This script will now ask you the relevant information to create the SSL certificate of OpenVAS.
Note that this information will *NOT* be sent to anybody (everything stays local), but anyone with the ability to connect to your OpenVAS daemon will be able to retrieve this information.

Congratulations. Your server certificate was properly created.

The following files were created:

Certification authority:
   Certificate = /etc/pki/openvas/CA/cacert.pem

User rules

----------
openvassd has a rules system which allows you to restrict the hosts that  has the right to test.
For instance, you may want him to be able to scan his own host only.
Please see the openvas-adduser(8) man page for the rules syntax.
Enter the rules for this user, and hit ctrl-D once you are done:
(the user can have an empty rules set)
User om added to OpenVAS.

<p>Setup GPG trust of the nvt feed. You&#39;ll need to create a GPG key for openvas,
download and verify the transfer integrity key, import &amp; sign the transfer
integrity key and turn on plugin signature checking. This can be done with the
following set of commands:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>[root@localhost ~]# mkdir /etc/openvas/gnupg

You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.

You don't want a passphrase - this is probably a *bad* idea!
I will do it anyway.  You can change your passphrase at any time,
using this program with the option &quot;--edit-key&quot;.

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

<p>Alright now we need to start up the scanner service for the first time. It will
take a LONG time the first time and a significant amount of time everytime
there are updates to the NVT feed, though not nearly as long for the updates.</p>

<p>It takes so long that the service script will think that it failed. It HASN&#39;T,
it&#39;s still doing it magic in the background, it&#39;s easiest to just watch it go
with top. When it finally settles down it&#39;ll be ready for the next step.</p>

<h2>OpenVAS Manager</h2>

<p>Now we need to build the OpenVAS manager database. I&#39;m not entirely sure what
the manager gets us as right now we have a working scanner (albeit without
users). I know it provides alternative connection methods such as an XML based
API for web services. Hey it might be useful it might not and there is some
funnyness but it&#39;s part of the full installation so I&#39;m going to include
directions.</p>

<p>That touch at the beginning? Yeah if you don&#39;t create that file you&#39;ll get a
&quot;Aborted (core dumped)&quot; message when you try and rebuild the database. Having
it in existence though allows it to just run smoothly. Pretty big bug if you
ask me but one with an easy work around.</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>[root@localhost ~]# touch /var/lib/openvas/mgr/tasks.db
[root@localhost ~]# openvasmd --rebuild
</pre></div>
</div>

<h2>OpenVAS Administrator</h2>

<p>This is getting it&#39;s own special section as it isn&#39;t available via the standard
Fedora package repositories annoyingly enough. For the time being I&#39;m going to
leave this alone.</p>

<h2>Creating Users</h2>

<p>I personally prefer using certificate for authentication against the server.
Easier than typing in a password every time and more secure in some ways. To
create a user that authenticates with a certificate you need to use the
<code>openvas-mkcert-client</code> command like so:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>[root@localhost ~]# openvas-mkcert-client
This script will now ask you the relevant information to create the SSL client certificates for OpenVAS.

installation or steps you skipped.</p>

<h2>Scanning</h2>

<p>I&#39;m going to assume that you&#39;re using the openvas-client as the scanning
client. Here are a few quick notes for setting up a decent scan setup</p>

<ul>
<li>Global Settings

<ul>
<li>General</li>
<li>Range: default</li>
<li>20 concurrent hosts</li>
<li>5 concurrent checks</li>
<li>Do a reverse lookup</li>
<li>Optimize the test</li>
<li>Safe checks</li>
<li>Scanners

<ul>
<li>OpenVAS TCP Scanner</li>
<li>Ping Host</li>
<li>Nmap (NASL wrapper)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Plugins</li>
<li>Enable All</li>
<li>Enable at runtime</li>
<li>Not Silent</li>
<li>Automatically enable new plugins</li>
<li>Credentials</li>
<li>(Optional but a more thorough scan is done with them)</li>
<li>SSH credentials need to be managed through the Extras-&gt;LSC Credentials Manager in the tool bar. It annoyingly does not support simple username/password SSH combos very well requiring you to generate a key pair, set a comment on the keypair (without spaces), and a password on the key pair EVEN IF YOU DON&#39;T INTEND TO USE IT.</li>
<li>Leave target selection as localhost only, these are the global configuration options and you should be forced to set them for each set of scans</li>
<li>KB</li>
<li>Enable KB Saving</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>When you&#39;re ready to create a scan create a new &quot;Task&quot; I usually create a Task
per organization that I intend to scan and allows me to organize both different
kinds of scans for that organization as well as multiple scanners.</p>

<p>Create a &quot;Scope&quot; inside the Task, this will request logging into the server
that you&#39;ll be running the scan from and will inherit all of the global
settings. Adjust the target selection and make scan specific adjustments then
Launch!</p>
